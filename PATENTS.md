# Patents

This repository maintains summaries of patentable components in ABZU. Drafts live under [patents/](patents/).

## Summaries

- **OROBOROS Core** – A self-referential calculus engine extending lambda calculus to integrate paradox and symbolic glyph mappings for narrative computation.
- **MemoryBundle** – A unified memory interface that synchronizes cortex, emotional, mental, spiritual, and narrative layers, broadcasting initialization pulses and aggregating multi-layer queries.
- **Crown Servant Orchestration** – A runtime delegation layer where the Crown agent coordinates specialized servant models, launching and monitoring them via health-checked endpoints to handle tasks in parallel.
- **Chakra Cycle Engine** – A heartbeat scheduler that paces Root through Crown layers, probing their health endpoints on each tick and tracking gear ratios to expose drift.
