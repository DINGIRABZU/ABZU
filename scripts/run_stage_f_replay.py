        environment-limited: stage-f replay requires a reserved gate-runner window.

        Planned execution flow once hardware access is restored:
          1. Validate the sandbox evidence bundle:
               - Stage C readiness packet
               - Stage B rotation ledger
               - Stage E transport snapshot
             Stage the resulting manifest for upload.
          2. Reserve the Stage F gate-runner slot and provision the Neo-APSU toolchain.
             Sync parity binaries to the hardware workspace.
          3. Invoke the Neo-APSU replay routines on hardware. Stream parity traces and
             rollback drills into the Stage F evidence bundle.
             Capture approvals before updating roadmap and status ledgers.
