# Stageâ€¯B Audio Samples

The reference tracks for `run_song_demo.py` are packaged outside Git. Download
and extract the bundle declared in
[`evidence_manifests/stage-b-audio.json`](../evidence_manifests/stage-b-audio.json)
so the demo files appear in this directory:

```bash
aws s3 cp s3://abzu-stage-b-rehearsals/stage-b-audio-20250218T120000Z.tar.gz .
tar -xzf stage-b-audio-20250218T120000Z.tar.gz -C SONS_FOR_TESTS
```

The manifest captures the archive checksum and upload hint; CI enforces these
values so reviewers can trace the evidence bundle without shipping binaries in
Git history.
