"""Stub coverage for the memory contract evidence.

This module references the narrative in ``docs/contracts/memory.md`` and
the ``memory_store.py`` row of ``docs/apsu_migration_matrix.md``. When the
Neo-APSU bundle is available in CI or hardware, extend these tests to
exercise the real persistence path and telemetry comparisons.
