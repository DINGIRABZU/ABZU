# IGNITION Doctrine

Refer to the [Doctrine Index](../docs/doctrine_index.md) for canonical files, versions, and update history.

RAZAR ignites the stack and, together with the
[Nazarick Agents](../docs/nazarick_agents.md), forms the nervous system that
routes lifecycle events across the chakras. Consult the
[RAZAR Guide](../docs/RAZAR_GUIDE.md) for orchestration details.
