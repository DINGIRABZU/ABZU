# Co-creation Framework

This document outlines the feedback loop between developers and INANNA_AI to refine features collaboratively.

## Feedback Cycle
1. **Proposal** – Developers submit plans or patches and reference relevant specs.
2. **Evaluation** – INANNA_AI reviews changes, logs insights, and flags alignment issues.
3. **Revision** – Developers adjust implementations based on AI feedback and repository protocols.
4. **Integration** – Approved changes merge, and lessons feed back into future iterations.

## Objectives
- Keep human and AI contributors in continuous dialogue.
- Surface design tensions early to avoid downstream rewrites.
- Preserve a transparent record of discussions for future reference.
