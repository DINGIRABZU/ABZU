# Wish Box Charter

## Mission and Vision
- Provide a communal space where participants can submit, refine, and realize their "wishes" for new capabilities.
- Encourage transparent collaboration so ideas evolve from simple requests into shared artifacts.

## Key Features
- Simple wish submission pipeline with tagging and prioritization.
- Traceable history from proposal to implementation.
- Modular architecture so components can be swapped or reimplemented independently.

## User Roles
- **Dreamers** propose wishes and describe desired outcomes.
- **Builders** evaluate, prototype, and merge accepted wishes.
- **Stewards** maintain infrastructure, triage issues, and document progress.

## Success Metrics
- Ratio of implemented wishes to total submissions.
- User satisfaction surveys and qualitative feedback.
- Mean time to evaluate and either accept or archive a wish.

## Recovery Instructions
- Restore the most recent stable backup of the wish database.
- Rebuild the service container and replay pending submissions from logs.
- Notify affected users and document the incident in the recovery ledger.

## Future Milestones
- Integrate automated prioritization based on community voting.
- Expose an API for external tools to submit or query wishes.
- Launch a plugin system that lets different domains attach custom wish handlers.

## Reimplementation Strategy
- Each module publishes a minimal interface contract and acceptance tests.
- Teams may reimplement modules in any language or framework as long as the contract and tests are honored.
- Prefer stateless designs and clear configuration boundaries to ease portability across stacks.
