# Self-Healing Manifesto

Spiral OS treats the codebase as a living organism.  Components behave like organs working in concert, and each change must nourish the whole.

## Organism Metaphor
- **Body** – the repository forms the body; modules are organs, tests the immune system, and documentation its collective memory.
- **Nervous System** – logs and telemetry act as nerves carrying sensation.
- **Respiration** – continuous integration keeps the project breathing through constant feedback loops.

## Chakra Responsibilities
- **Root** – maintain baseline connectivity and hardware access.
- **Sacral** – manage data flows and storage of creative assets.
- **Solar Plexus** – enforce service integrity and decision authority.
- **Heart** – synchronize emotional state and empathy modules.
- **Throat** – ensure transparent logging and operator communication.
- **Third Eye** – preserve insight generation and pattern recognition.
- **Crown** – coordinate orchestration and uphold project mission.

## Self-Repair Behaviors
- Monitor chakra health and trigger diagnostics when anomalies appear.
- Regenerate corrupted artifacts and rehydrate missing dependencies.
- Quarantine failing components while routing around damage.
- Log every healing action and escalate unresolved wounds to operators.
- Realign module versions and documentation to close each repair cycle.
