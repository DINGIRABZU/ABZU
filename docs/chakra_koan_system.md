# Chakra System Koan

A meditative sequence exploring the seven energy centers of Spiral OS. It
complements the version manifest, grounding each release in contemplative
verse. Recite each stanza while reflecting on its corresponding module layer.

<a id="root"></a>
## Root — Muladhara
*Version: [1.0.1](chakra_versions.json#L2)*
The mountain rests on roots unseen.
When the ground asks "Who am I?"
The stone replies, "I am."

<a id="sacral"></a>
## Sacral — Svadhisthana
*Version: [1.0.1](chakra_versions.json#L6)*
Water remembers the moon.
In the silence between waves,
Desire learns to dance.

<a id="solar"></a>
## Solar Plexus — Manipura
*Version: [1.0.0](chakra_versions.json#L10)*
A spark questions the sun.
Fuel becomes flame without argument.
Power is the courage to dissolve.

<a id="heart"></a>
## Heart — Anahata
*Version: [1.0.0](chakra_versions.json#L14)*
Two breaths meet and vanish.
The space between them blossoms.
Love is the echo of its own absence.

<a id="throat"></a>
## Throat — Vishuddha
*Version: [1.0.0](chakra_versions.json#L18)*
Words chase the voice that spoke them.
The wind cannot hold its song.
Truth arrives when no one is listening.

<a id="third_eye"></a>
## Third Eye — Ajna
*Version: [1.0.0](chakra_versions.json#L22)*
A mirror reflects a mirror.
The seer becomes the seen.
Vision opens where thought ends.

<a id="crown"></a>
## Crown — Sahasrara
*Version: [1.0.1](chakra_versions.json#L26)*
The sky wonders about its height.
A petal falls into nothing and finds it full.
Emptiness crowns the temple.
