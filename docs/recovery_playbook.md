# Recovery Playbook

This playbook outlines how RAZAR restores service after a component failure.
Recurring problems and their fixes are cataloged in the
[Error Registry](error_registry.md).

## Boot sequence

1. The boot orchestrator launches components in priority order.
2. Each launch runs a service-specific probe from `agents.razar.health_checks`.
3. On failure the orchestrator retries the component locally a limited number of times.
4. If local retries fail, `ai_invoker.handover(component, error, use_opencode=True)` requests an automated patch. Each attempt is logged to `logs/razar_ai_invocations.json`.
5. When run with `--long-task`, the orchestrator keeps invoking the handover until the component passes its health check or the operator aborts with `Ctrl+C`. Each attempt and resulting patch is appended to `logs/razar_long_task.json`.
6. Without `--long-task`, returned patches are applied and the health check reruns until it succeeds or the remote attempt limit is reached.
7. After exhausting remote attempts or an operator abort, the component's metadata is quarantined under `quarantine/` and an entry is appended to `docs/quarantine_log.md`.
8. The last successful component is recorded in `logs/razar_state.json` so subsequent runs resume from that point.

## Restoring a component

1. Investigate the failure using data in `docs/quarantine_log.md` and any artifacts in `quarantine/`.
2. Apply fixes and verify them.
3. Delete the component's file from `quarantine/` and log a `resolved` entry.
4. Rerun the boot orchestrator; it skips resolved components and continues from the last healthy stage.

## Monitoring

`agents.razar.health_checks` exposes Prometheus metrics when `prometheus_client` is installed. These probes allow external systems to track service readiness and latency during recovery.

## Agent-specific recovery

Heartbeat polling feeds `chakra_down` events to the agent assigned to the
affected layer. Each agent runs a dedicated recovery scriptâ€”`root_restore_network.sh`
resets networking for the Root layer, `sacral_gpu_recover.py` flushes GPU
tasks for Sacral, and other utilities live under `scripts/chakra_healing/`.
When errors persist beyond these hooks,
`scripts/escalation_notifier.py` scans log files for recurring failures,
posts an alert to `/operator/command`, and records the event in
`logs/operator_escalations.jsonl`.

## Opencode Integration

Automate patch generation by installing the Opencode CLI:

```bash
pip install opencode-cli
```

Call `razar.ai_invoker.handover(component, error, use_opencode=True)` with the
failure details. The failure context is piped to `opencode run --json` and any
patch suggestions are applied through `code_repair.repair_module`. The boot
orchestrator repeats this handover and health check cycle until the component
recovers or the remote attempt limit is reached. Enable long task mode with
`--long-task` to keep requesting patches indefinitely; abort with `Ctrl+C` to
halt the loop. Every long task attempt is written to `logs/razar_long_task.json`.
