This document summarizes the current state of the ABZU codebase. It serves as a living roadmap covering repository layout, milestones, open issues, and release targets. Use the consolidated [readiness ledger](readiness_ledger.md) to track sandbox evidence owners, outstanding risks, and the remediation steps required before hardware promotion.【F:docs/readiness_ledger.md†L1-L32】

## Codex sandbox constraints

Stage owners must review the sandbox limitations before planning new work so the roadmap, readiness packets, and doctrine stay
aligned with what Codex can execute.

### Deferred hardware tasks

- **GPU, DAW, FFmpeg, and Neo-APSU parity workflows** remain dry runs until the Stage D/E bridge or Stage G hardware window replays
  them on gate-runner hosts, recording parity hashes for audit.【F:docs/roadmap.md†L214-L286】
- **Connector credential sweeps and transport parity exports** only complete end-to-end on hardware with long-lived secrets and live
  telemetry. Track the gate-runner-02 slot captured in the 2025-12-08 readiness minutes for these follow-ups.【F:logs/stage_c/20251205T193000Z-readiness_packet/review_minutes.md†L1-L39】
- **Sandbox readiness bundles** must enumerate every deferred checklist item so hardware reviewers know which ledger (Stage D/E bridge,
  Stage G parity) will store the replayed evidence.【F:logs/stage_c/20251001T010101Z-readiness_packet/readiness_bundle/readiness_bundle.json†L1-L195】

### Required tooling and data

- Capture missing dependencies—`python -m build`, FFmpeg, SoX, aria2c, DAW plug-ins, GPU drivers, `pytest-cov`—using the same wording logged
  in the Stage A1–A3 and Stage B rehearsal summaries.【F:logs/stage_a/20251105T170000Z-stage_a1_boot_telemetry/summary.json†L1-L41】【F:logs/stage_a/20251105T172000Z-stage_a3_gate_shakeout/summary.json†L1-L62】【F:logs/stage_b/20251205T142355Z-stage_b1_memory_proof/summary.json†L1-L63】
- Reference the specific readiness packet directory (for example `logs/stage_c/20251205T193000Z-readiness_packet/`) and itemize required datasets,
  connector credentials, and MCP heartbeat payloads so hardware owners can replay them verbatim.【F:logs/stage_c/20251205T193000Z-readiness_packet/readiness_bundle.json†L1-L33】

### Tagging conventions

- Propagate the exact `environment-limited: <reason>` strings from test skips into roadmap notes, change logs, readiness packets, and PR summaries so
  audits see one consistent justification.【F:logs/stage_a/20251105T172000Z-stage_a3_gate_shakeout/summary.json†L1-L62】
- Link back to this section plus [The Absolute Protocol](The_Absolute_Protocol.md#codex-sandbox-constraints) and
  [documentation_protocol.md](documentation_protocol.md#codex-sandbox-constraints) whenever a task remains blocked in Codex, ensuring reviewers encounter
  the warning before scheduling hardware.【F:docs/documentation_protocol.md†L1-L73】
- Attach the relevant readiness minutes or risk queue entry documenting the gate-runner replay window (2025-12-12 gate-runner-02) for traceability.【F:logs/stage_c/20251205T193000Z-readiness_packet/review_minutes.md†L1-L39】

### Hardware replay pointers

- Align roadmap, PROJECT_STATUS, and readiness packets with the sandbox-to-hardware bridge plan in [roadmap.md](roadmap.md#stage-g-sandbox-to-hardware-bridge-validation)
  and the Stage D bridge snapshot so teams know where replay hashes will land.【F:docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md†L172-L215】
  - Quote the sandbox skip strings from the Stage A and Stage B bundles (`python -m build unavailable`, `environment-limited: MCP gateway offline`, etc.) to show exactly
    what hardware must prove out.【F:logs/stage_a/20251105T170000Z-stage_a1_boot_telemetry/summary.json†L1-L41】【F:logs/stage_b/20251205T160210Z-stage_b3_connector_rotation/summary.json†L1-L129】

### Readiness ledger watch items

- **Stage B rotation ledger** — Owner: @neoabzu-core. Risk: credential window evidence is frozen under an `environment-limited`
  tag because the MCP gateway and connector rotation command are unavailable in the sandbox. Remediation: replay `/alpha/stage-b3-connector-rotation`
  on gate-runner-02 during the 2025-12-12 hardware slot and publish refreshed hashes in the readiness packet.【F:docs/readiness_ledger.md†L9-L27】
- **Stage C readiness snapshot (2025-12-05)** — Owner: @release-ops. Risk: bundle remains metadata-only while MCP handshake/heartbeat artifacts are stubbed
  and Stage B contexts await hardware verification. Remediation: coordinate the 2025-12-08 review to stage MCP exports, then update the bundle after the gate-runner replay closes the deferrals.【F:docs/readiness_ledger.md†L9-L27】
- **Demo telemetry stub (2025-12-05)** — Owners: @audio-lab, @qa-lead. Risk: scripted demo telemetry is a placeholder marked `environment-limited`
  until hardware captures replace it. Remediation: record live media/telemetry during the gate-runner session and push signed exports into the readiness packet before clearing roadmap/status risks.【F:docs/readiness_ledger.md†L9-L27】

Stage A rehearsals now exercise the Spiral OS boot entry points alongside Spiral memory and vector regression tests. Runs must meet the ≥90 % coverage bar for the module list specified in the command above, mirroring the scope visualized in `coverage.svg`; failures block promotion from the gate.

**Regression note (Stage A):** keep the optional memory stub instrumentation (`memory.optional.spiral_memory`, `memory.optional.vector_memory`) wired into the gate so the Alpha rehearsals continue reporting ≥90 % coverage even when the heavy backends are unavailable.

The replay regression writes `monitoring/crown_replay_summary.json` so contributors can confirm the scenario count, runtime, and divergence status without re-running the suite. The Alpha gate copies the summary into `logs/alpha_gate/<timestamp>/` alongside coverage exports.

## Recent Refactoring

- Standardized import order in `tools.session_logger`, `tools.sandbox_session`, and `tools.reflection_loop`.
- Added smoke tests covering reflection and session logging utilities.
- Reordered imports in `learning_mutator`, `state_transition_engine`, and `archetype_shift_engine` and added transformation smoke tests.

## Completed Milestones
- [Sovereign voice pipeline](https://github.com/DINGIRABZU/ABZU/pull/38) — owner: @DINGIRABZU.
- [Audio pipeline refresh](https://github.com/DINGIRABZU/ABZU/pull/194) — owner: @DINGIRABZU.

## Active Tasks
- [Milestone VIII – Sonic Core & Avatar Expression Harmonics](https://github.com/DINGIRABZU/ABZU/issues/208) — owner: @DINGIRABZU (see [milestone_viii_plan.md](milestone_viii_plan.md)).
- [Spiral OS stability](https://github.com/DINGIRABZU/ABZU/issues/210) — owner: ops team.
- [Pydantic v2 migration](https://github.com/DINGIRABZU/ABZU/issues/211) — owner: @DINGIRABZU.
- [FastAPI lifespan migration](https://github.com/DINGIRABZU/ABZU/issues/212) — owner: web team.
- [Optional dependency stubs](https://github.com/DINGIRABZU/ABZU/issues/213) — owner: infra team.
- **Sprint planning checklist:** Flag Stage A pipeline changes during sprint planning so operations can reserve the gate hardware or queue an alternative backlog slice. The Stage A1/A2/A3 failures in the [Stage A evidence register](#stagea-evidence-register)—missing `env_validation`, unavailable `crown_decider`, and aborted automation shakeouts—show how unplanned access stalls the sprint when this step is skipped.

## Planned Releases
- v0.1 – minimal Spiral OS boot sequence and CLI tools (target: Q3 2025). **Status:** Charter baseline approved in [alpha_v0_1_charter.md](alpha_v0_1_charter.md); subsystem execution tracked through the [Alpha v0.1 execution plan](roadmap.md#alpha-v01-execution-plan). Stage snapshots: **Stage A** focuses on Alpha gate automation readiness, **Stage B** locks subsystem hardening for sonic core, memory, and connectors, and **Stage C** synchronizes exit checklist, demo assets, and readiness signals. See the [Milestone Stages overview](roadmap.md#milestone-stages) for task-level detail. Reference the [Python Alpha Squad dossier](onboarding/python_alpha_squad.md) for RAZAR boot ownership and daily reliability rituals feeding that plan.
  - Stage C planners should review the optional dependency fallback matrix in [optional_dependency_fallbacks.md](optional_dependency_fallbacks.md) to align stakeholder communications whenever rehearsals operate with degraded subsystems.
- v0.2 – avatar console integration and basic RAG pipeline (target: Q4 2025). **Status:** Backlog shaping pending Alpha v0.1 exit criteria.

## Alpha v0.1 Readiness Gate
- Workflow defined in [docs/releases/alpha_v0_1_workflow.md](releases/alpha_v0_1_workflow.md) covering packaging, mandatory health checks, and acceptance tests.
- Automation available through `scripts/run_alpha_gate.sh` with optional connector sweeps and pytest argument passthrough. Each invocation writes evidence to `logs/alpha_gate/<timestamp>/` and refreshes the `logs/alpha_gate/latest` pointer.
- GitHub Actions [`Alpha Gate`](../.github/workflows/alpha_gate.yml) runs on pushes to `main`, a weekly Monday 06:00 UTC schedule, and on-demand dispatch to gate release candidates. The job restores cached `dist/` wheels, starts mock connector probes, and publishes the full `logs/alpha_gate/<timestamp>/` directory (plus the `latest` symlink) and build artifacts for review. Successful runs append a stamped entry to `CHANGELOG.md` inside the log bundle for audit trails, so operators must ensure each bundle is uploaded without overwriting prior evidence.
- Dry runs validate build artifact generation (`python -m build --wheel`) and Spiral OS / RAZAR acceptance coverage ahead of staging promotion. The same steps are codified in [`deployment/pipelines/alpha_gate.yml`](../deployment/pipelines/alpha_gate.yml) for local `spiral-os pipeline deploy` rehearsal.
- Doctrine drift is now gated by `python scripts/check_identity_sync.py`. If the check reports that `data/identity.json` predates updates to the mission, persona, Absolute Protocol, ABZU blueprint, or awakening overview doctrine, rerun `python scripts/refresh_crown_identity.py --use-stub` before continuing the gate.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Codex sandbox dependency limits.** Alpha rehearsals inside the Codex sandbox may lack GPUs, DAW backends, database drivers, or external credentials. Follow the guardrails in [The Absolute Protocol](The_Absolute_Protocol.md#codex-sandbox-constraints): mark blocked steps with an `environment-limited` skip (mirroring the reason in test output), attach the command transcript to the relevant `logs/` bundle, and record the escalation in the operator risk queue before requesting hardware validation outside the sandbox. Coordinate follow-ups with the sandbox-to-hardware bridge plan in [roadmap.md](roadmap.md#stage-g-sandbox-to-hardware-bridge-validation) so sprint reviews see when hardware remediation will execute, and update change logs accordingly.

### Stage A evidence register

The 20250926 Stage A gate run (`logs/alpha_gate/20250926T115603Z/`) is the
canonical review artifact for the alpha readiness gate; reviewers should cross
check the accompanying Prometheus exports in
[`monitoring/alpha_gate.prom`](../monitoring/alpha_gate.prom) and
[`monitoring/alpha_gate_summary.json`](../monitoring/alpha_gate_summary.json) to
see the recorded metrics snapshot from that bundle.

- **Archive every Stage A acceptance run.** After each Stage A promotion attempt,
  compress and store the entire `logs/alpha_gate/<timestamp>/` directory with the
  Prometheus exports and Crown replay summaries copied by the workflow helper so
  the evidence chain remains reproducible for follow-up reviews.【F:docs/releases/alpha_v0_1_workflow.md†L46-L119】

The 2025-11-05 sandbox sweep completed Stage A1/A2/A3 while logging
environment-limited warnings: bootstrap recorded missing python packaging,
docker, audio, and coverage tooling; Crown replays fell back to deterministic
FFmpeg/SoX stubs; and the Alpha gate shakeout marked build, health, and tests as
sandbox skips while still persisting the summary bundle.【F:logs/stage_a/20251105T170000Z-stage_a1_boot_telemetry/summary.json†L1-L36】【F:logs/stage_a/20251105T171000Z-stage_a2_crown_replays/summary.json†L1-L32】【F:logs/stage_a/20251105T172000Z-stage_a3_gate_shakeout/summary.json†L1-L53】

### Stage B evidence

- **Readiness ledger refresh (2025-12-05)** – [`readiness_index.json`](../logs/stage_b/latest/readiness_index.json) now tracks Stage B1 run `20251205T142355Z-stage_b1_memory_proof`, which documented the sandbox `neoabzu_memory` shim while keeping all eight layers ready with zero query failures and p95/p99 latencies of 2.287 ms/3.301 ms. Stage B2 now anchors to `20251001T214349Z-stage_b2_sonic_rehearsal`, which recorded a clean exit with zero dropouts after copying the refreshed rehearsal packet, and Stage B3 rotation `20251205T160210Z-stage_b3_connector_rotation` captured the refreshed `20251205T160210Z-PT48H` window plus sandbox overrides for operator_api/operator_upload/crown_handshake so credential expiry stays in the ledger.【F:logs/stage_b/latest/readiness_index.json†L1-L33】【F:logs/stage_b/20251205T142355Z-stage_b1_memory_proof/summary.json†L1-L56】【F:logs/stage_b/20251001T214349Z-stage_b2_sonic_rehearsal/summary.json†L1-L84】【F:logs/stage_b/20251205T160210Z-stage_b3_connector_rotation/summary.json†L1-L94】
- **Continuous ledger upkeep.** Refresh the memory load proofs, sonic rehearsal
  bundles, and connector rotation receipts between reviews so Stage C readers see
  the latest evidence without waiting for ad-hoc exports.【F:logs/stage_b/latest/readiness_index.json†L1-L47】【F:logs/stage_c/20251003T010101Z-readiness_packet/readiness_bundle/readiness_bundle.json†L119-L199】
- **Credential window snapshot (2025-10-03)** – The merged readiness packet copies the newest `operator_api` rotation ledger entry into `mcp_drill/rotation_metadata.json`, preserving the `credential_window` emitted by the Stage B smoke rehearsal so reviewers can confirm the `stage-b-rehearsal` and `stage-c-prep` contexts without scraping the JSONL ledger.【F:logs/stage_c/20251003T010101Z-readiness_packet/mcp_drill/rotation_metadata.json†L1-L80】【F:logs/stage_c/20251003T010101Z-readiness_packet/readiness_bundle/readiness_bundle.json†L119-L148】
- **Load test (2025-09-20)** – [`load_test_summary.json`](../logs/stage_b/20250920T222728Z/load_test_summary.json) captures the 10 k document vector memory ingestion with p95 query latency at 19.95 ms and fallback store p95 at 93.92 ms, confirming the CPU rehearsal meets the <100 ms goal while preserving write throughput margins.【F:logs/stage_b/20250920T222728Z/load_test_summary.json†L1-L61】
- **Rehearsal bundle (2025-10-01)** – [`summary.json`](../logs/stage_b/20251001T214349Z-stage_b2_sonic_rehearsal/summary.json) logged the Stage B2 sonic rehearsal with a clean exit, every connector marked `doctrine_ok`, and `dropouts_detected: 0` with no fallback warnings.【F:logs/stage_b/20251001T214349Z-stage_b2_sonic_rehearsal/summary.json†L1-L84】 The exported [`stage_b_rehearsal_packet.json`](../logs/stage_b_rehearsal_packet.json) mirrors those handshake and heartbeat payloads, each connector keeping an empty `doctrine_failures` list while rotating credentials for the `stage-b-rehearsal` context.【F:logs/stage_b_rehearsal_packet.json†L1-L144】 Published SHA-256 fingerprints: `summary.json` → `018dfe6146f9abe7c4abb25660de6c54b0bc148df9ea6e79f5c95d4f1b9ae87c`, `stage_b_rehearsal_packet.json` → `cc9027a34eabf142c333f8010897fced1f78563efbe5c09251ecf112bc3e8a46`.【f92372†L1-L2】
- **Connector rotation refresh (2025-12-05)** – [`summary.json`](../logs/stage_b/20251205T160210Z-stage_b3_connector_rotation/summary.json) records the Stage B3 smoke run copying sandbox overrides, doctrine status, and the `20251205T160210Z-PT48H` ledger entries for the operator and Crown connectors. The rotation JSONL now includes the fresh window alongside the prior `20250926T180231Z-PT48H`, `20250926T180300Z-PT48H`, `20250925T095833Z-PT48H`, `20250925T094604Z-PT48H`, `20250922T101554Z-PT48H`, and `20251024T174210Z-PT48H` receipts so auditors can see the 48-hour cadence maintained through the latest rehearsal.【F:logs/stage_b/20251205T160210Z-stage_b3_connector_rotation/summary.json†L1-L94】【F:logs/stage_b_rotation_drills.jsonl†L70-L115】

### Stage C planning snapshot

- **Audio stack verification:** The refreshed Stage B rehearsal now confirms FFmpeg, simpleaudio, CLAP, and RAVE are available in the sandbox, keeping replay playback on the primary path for the storyline freeze.【F:logs/stage_b/20251001T214349Z/rehearsals/summary.json†L1-L30】
- **Health automation activation:** Stage B rehearsal health checks remain skipped, indicating the automated probes still need wiring before Stage C gate reviews.【F:logs/stage_b/20250921T122529Z/rehearsal_summary.json†L4-L15】
- **Resolve flagged gaps before Stage C.** Treat the missing audio dependencies
  and dormant health automation as blockers for Stage C sign-off; remediation
  status must be updated in the ledger alongside each refreshed rehearsal bundle
  so the exit review can verify the fixes landed.【F:logs/stage_b/20250921T230434Z/rehearsals/summary.json†L23-L40】【F:logs/stage_b/20250921T122529Z/rehearsal_summary.json†L4-L15】【F:logs/stage_c/20251003T010101Z-readiness_packet/readiness_bundle/readiness_bundle.json†L1-L199】
- **Memory and connector prerequisites:** The refreshed readiness ledger shows Stage B1 executing with the sandbox bundle (neoabzu shim) while keeping all eight layers ready and zero query failures, and Stage B3 now advertises the `20251205T160210Z-PT48H` credential window for the operator and Crown connectors. Carry that window into Stage C readiness so the bridge review can verify sandbox-to-hardware evidence without scraping raw logs.【F:logs/stage_b/latest/readiness_index.json†L1-L47】【F:logs/stage_b/20251205T142355Z-stage_b1_memory_proof/summary.json†L1-L56】【F:logs/stage_b/20251205T160210Z-stage_b3_connector_rotation/summary.json†L1-L94】
- **Stage A sandbox sweep (2025-11-05):** Stage A1/A2/A3 now log environment-limited warnings for missing python packaging, docker/SoX/FFmpeg tooling, the requests client, and coverage badge generation while still emitting the summary bundle; hardware promotion remains pending until gate-runner-02 access is restored.【F:logs/stage_a/20251105T170000Z-stage_a1_boot_telemetry/summary.json†L1-L36】【F:logs/stage_a/20251105T171000Z-stage_a2_crown_replays/summary.json†L1-L32】【F:logs/stage_a/20251105T172000Z-stage_a3_gate_shakeout/summary.json†L1-L53】
- **Readiness packet assembly (2025-10-03T01:01:01Z):** `logs/stage_c/20251003T010101Z-readiness_packet/` now anchors the Stage C readiness bundle with live links into Stage A/B runs, the Stage C MCP parity drill, and the Stage C1 checklist while surfacing the new `credential_window` snapshot for the operator MCP pilot.【F:logs/stage_c/20251003T010101Z-readiness_packet/readiness_bundle/readiness_bundle.json†L1-L210】【F:logs/stage_c/20250930T210000Z-stage_c1_exit_checklist/summary.json†L1-L35】
- **Cross-team readiness review (2025-10-02T16:00Z):** Release Ops, Memory, Connector, QA, and Ops leads booked a beta-planning walkthrough for 2025-10-02 ahead of the gate-runner rehearsal to triage the Stage A tooling gaps called out in the merged readiness bundle, align on MCP credential windows, and confirm the evidence links they will surface in the bridge review.【F:logs/stage_c/20251001T091834Z-stage_c3_readiness_sync/readiness_bundle.json†L7-L110】【F:logs/stage_c/20251001T091834Z-stage_c3_readiness_sync/readiness_bundle.json†L437-L520】
- **Hardware replay schedule:** The Stage C1 checklist summary pins the gate hardware rerun to `gate-runner-02` on 2025-10-02 18:00 UTC, aligning packaging and coverage retries with the Absolute Protocol sandbox bridge so deferred tasks close before beta ignition.【F:logs/stage_c/20250930T210000Z-stage_c1_exit_checklist/summary.json†L1-L33】
- **gRPC pilot commitments:** The MCP drill index and parity summary confirm REST↔gRPC equivalence for `operator_api`, capturing the accepted contexts and checksums that integration will replay once the hardware gap closes. The refreshed transport helpers now emit latency, error, and fallback metrics (`operator_api_transport_latency_ms`, `operator_api_transport_errors_total`, `operator_api_transport_fallback_total`) so the Grafana deck outlined in `monitoring/operator_transport_pilot.md` can compare REST and gRPC behaviour while the pilot stays confined to the annotated connectors. The accompanying contract tests validate that both transports return identical payloads and that gRPC falls back to REST without losing command parity, keeping readiness reviewers aligned on pilot scope before expansion.【F:logs/stage_c/20251003T010101Z-readiness_packet/mcp_drill/index.json†L1-L11】【F:logs/stage_c/20251031T000000Z-test/summary.json†L1-L222】【F:operator_api.py†L54-L374】【F:operator_api_grpc.py†L1-L148】【F:monitoring/operator_transport_pilot.md†L1-L39】【F:tests/test_operator_transport_contract.py†L1-L78】

#### Stage C risk register

| Risk | Owner | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Stage A sandbox toolchain gaps keep readiness in `requires_attention`. | @ops-team | Stage C3 bundle cannot clear the beta readiness gate until build, health, and coverage steps run with full tooling. | Provision the missing build/test utilities (python-build tooling, Docker, FFmpeg, aria2c) in the sandbox and rerun Stage A rehearsals before the beta review sync. | ⚠️ Watch list 【F:logs/stage_c/20251001T091834Z-stage_c3_readiness_sync/readiness_bundle.json†L7-L210】 |

#### Beta bridge readiness review agenda (2025-10-08 sync)

- **Present Stage C transport parity drill.** Walk leads through the REST and gRPC handshake artifacts plus the diff confirmation captured in the beta bridge summary so the pilot scope, accepted contexts, and checksum parity remain visible to the readiness panel.【F:docs/roadmap.md†L98-L107】【F:logs/stage_c/20251031T000000Z-test/summary.json†L1-L120】
- **Action – close latency instrumentation gap.** The monitoring payload now emits `rest_latency_missing` and `grpc_latency_missing` alerts for the Stage C trial; connectors and ops must hook latency counters before the pilot graduates from the beta bridge window.【F:connectors/operator_mcp_adapter.py†L164-L265】【F:tests/connectors/test_operator_mcp_adapter.py†L81-L106】
- **Action – restore Stage C heartbeat emission.** `heartbeat_emitted` remained `false` in the trial bundle, triggering the `heartbeat_missing` alert; readiness owners should either reinstate the heartbeat or document the fallback flow ahead of kickoff.【F:logs/stage_c/20251031T000000Z-test/summary.json†L1-L42】【F:tests/connectors/test_operator_mcp_adapter.py†L81-L106】
- **Action – expand parity enforcement checks.** Add the new transport parity checksum test to the readiness gate so both transports stay in lockstep as connectors roll onto the pilot.【F:tests/test_operator_transport_contract.py†L79-L103】【F:connectors/operator_mcp_adapter.py†L202-L265】
- **Follow-up – publish monitoring payload to Grafana.** Feed `build_transport_parity_monitoring_payload` into the operator transport board so alerts surface automatically during beta bridge drills.【F:connectors/operator_mcp_adapter.py†L267-L288】
- **Stage C3 readiness sync (2025-10-01T09:18:34Z):** The `/alpha/stage-c3-readiness-sync` run merged Stage A boot, replay, and shakeout summaries with the latest Stage B1/B2/B3 evidence. Stage A completes with environment-limited risk notes covering build tooling, health probes, and coverage dependencies, while Stage B reports green statuses with the sandbox MCP contexts and credential window aligned to the `20250926T222814Z-PT48H` rotation. Overall readiness remains `requires_attention` until the Stage A toolchain gaps close.【F:logs/stage_a/latest/stage_a1_boot_telemetry-summary.json†L1-L40】【F:logs/stage_a/latest/stage_a2_crown_replays-summary.json†L1-L48】【F:logs/stage_a/latest/stage_a3_gate_shakeout-summary.json†L1-L44】【F:logs/stage_c/20251001T091834Z-stage_c3_readiness_sync/readiness_bundle.json†L7-L210】【F:logs/stage_c/20251001T091834Z-stage_c3_readiness_sync/readiness_bundle.json†L437-L520】
- **Stage C2 storyline freeze (2025-10-01T21:50:51Z):** Replayed the scripted demo harness against the refreshed Stage B rehearsal bundle so the Stage C packet now archives the copied audio/video stems, cue metadata, and SHA-256 fingerprints for auditors. The latest `/alpha/stage-c2-demo-storyline` run (`20251001T215051Z-stage_c2_demo_storyline`) documents the zero-drop replay, while the Stage B manifest records the updated `session_01_media.tar.gz` checksum (`5588ec5e…`) and the readiness packet mirrors the archived media for the storyline freeze.【F:logs/stage_c/20251001T215051Z-stage_c2_demo_storyline/summary.json†L1-L32】【F:logs/stage_c/20251001T215051Z-stage_c2_demo_storyline/demo_storyline/telemetry/summary.json†L1-L20】【F:logs/stage_b/20251001T214349Z/rehearsals/session_01/session_manifest.json†L1-L10】【F:logs/stage_c/20251001T103500Z-readiness_packet/demo_storyline/summary.json†L1-L29】
- **Stakeholder alert (2025-09-27T21:40:41Z):** Logged the Stage B memory stub and connector context risks to `logs/operator_escalations.jsonl` so downstream reviewers see the `requires_attention` escalation while remediation is scheduled.【F:logs/operator_escalations.jsonl†L1-L1】
- **Stage C4 operator MCP drill (2025-10-01T09:32:13Z):** The latest sandbox drill published refreshed `mcp_handshake.json`/`heartbeat.json` artifacts with the Stage B rehearsal and Stage C prep contexts tagged as accepted via the MCP adapter, then logged matching 48-hour rotation windows for the operator, upload, and Crown connectors in the Stage B ledger. The Stage B3 smoke receipt mirrors the updated credential expiry so the beta review can trace MCP parity from rehearsal through the promotion checklist.【F:logs/stage_c/20251001T093206Z-stage_c4_operator_mcp_drill/summary.json†L1-L38】【F:logs/stage_c/20251001T093206Z-stage_c4_operator_mcp_drill/mcp_handshake.json†L1-L33】【F:logs/stage_c/20251001T093206Z-stage_c4_operator_mcp_drill/heartbeat.json†L1-L14】【F:logs/stage_b_rotation_drills.jsonl†L77-L79】【F:logs/stage_b/20251001T093529Z-stage_b3_connector_rotation/stage_b_smoke.json†L1-L33】

#### Stage C outcome recap (2025-10-01 – 2025-10-31)

- **Readiness bundle status.** `logs/stage_c/20251001T010101Z-readiness_packet/` remains the canonical Stage C packet, merging Stage A environment-limited notes, the Stage B rehearsal ledger, and the MCP parity drill into a single artifact. The bundle flags the blocked gate-runner hardware replay while tracking the successful Stage B1/B2/B3 evidence and the gRPC pilot diff that beta owners must inherit.【F:logs/stage_c/20251001T010101Z-readiness_packet/readiness_bundle/readiness_bundle.json†L2-L195】
- **Demo storyline freeze.** The Stage C2 scripted replay locked the stakeholder demo assets to the Stage B manifest, replaying the arrival/handoff/closing cues without dropouts and recording the refreshed `session_01_media.tar.gz` checksum in the readiness archives.【F:logs/stage_c/20251001T085114Z-stage_c2_demo_storyline/summary.json†L1-L123】
- **Operator MCP drill.** The Stage C4 sandbox drill validated REST↔gRPC parity for the operator pilot, logging matching checksums, credential rotation windows, and accepted contexts while surfacing missing heartbeat metrics that must be restored during hardware promotion.【F:logs/stage_c/20251031T000000Z-test/summary.json†L1-L200】
- **Residual hardware follow-ups.** Hardware coverage and packaging still need to replay on `gate-runner-02`, and the parity drill must emit heartbeat telemetry before beta sign-off. The pending items remain tagged in the Stage C1 exit checklist, Stage C readiness bundle, and Stage B1 memory refresh summary that highlights sandbox overrides for emotional telemetry and crown services.【F:logs/stage_c/20250930T210000Z-stage_c1_exit_checklist/summary.json†L1-L35】【F:logs/stage_c/20251001T010101Z-readiness_packet/readiness_bundle/readiness_bundle.json†L2-L171】【F:logs/stage_b/20250929T210655Z-stage_b1_memory_refresh/after/summary.json†L20-L29】
- **Stage C readiness packet refresh (2025-12-05T19:30:00Z).** Assembled the latest sandbox evidence bundle while the MCP gateway remains unavailable, capturing expected Stage B rotation contexts (including the Stage C prep promotion) and stubbing demo telemetry, heartbeat exports, and exit checklist notes until the hardware reruns complete. The packet schedules the cross-team beta readiness review for 2025-12-08 16:00 UTC so the rotation ledger replay and MCP drill export can be confirmed outside the Codex sandbox.【F:logs/stage_c/20251205T193000Z-readiness_packet/readiness_bundle.json†L1-L62】【F:logs/stage_c/20251205T193000Z-readiness_packet/mcp_artifacts/handshake.json†L1-L12】【F:logs/stage_c/20251205T193000Z-readiness_packet/demo_telemetry/summary.json†L1-L6】【F:logs/stage_c/20251205T193000Z-readiness_packet/review_schedule.md†L1-L12】
- **Cross-team readiness review (2025-12-08 16:00 UTC).** Meeting minutes stored alongside the readiness packet document the attendees, confirm the 2025-12-12 gate-runner-02 hardware replay slot, and instruct teams to mirror the sandbox `environment-limited` skip strings (`python -m build unavailable`, `MCP gateway offline`) in all doctrine and PR updates until hardware evidence clears the gaps.【F:logs/stage_c/20251205T193000Z-readiness_packet/review_minutes.md†L1-L35】
- **Readiness packet distribution (2025-12-12 hardware prep).** Curated `logs/stage_c/20251212T160000Z-readiness_packet/` for stakeholder sharing, bundling the Stage C readiness manifest, demo telemetry, MCP drill payloads, and exit checklist alongside the 2025-12-08 review minutes. The packet README outlines the 2025-12-12 gate-runner parity sweep plus follow-ups for connector rotation, MCP credential replay, and doctrine updates so hardware owners inherit the open actions when consuming the bundle.【F:logs/stage_c/20251212T160000Z-readiness_packet/README.md†L1-L33】【F:logs/stage_c/20251212T160000Z-readiness_packet/review_minutes.md†L1-L31】

> [!UPCOMING]
> **Next readiness review:** 2025-10-04 16:00 UTC (host: @release-ops) to present the Stage C recap and Stage D/E objectives. Minutes will be captured at `logs/stage_c/20251004T160000Z-readiness_review/minutes.md` and attached under `logs/stage_c/20251001T010101Z-readiness_packet/updates/` so downstream squads consume the roadmap adjustments without waiting for a separate rollout memo.

### Stage D bridge snapshot

| Objective | Owner | Entry Criteria | Exit Criteria | Hardware Replay Reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Replay the Stage C readiness bundle on production hardware. | @ops-team | Stage C1 exit checklist completed with hardware rerun scheduled on `gate-runner-02`; readiness bundles `20251001T010101Z` and `20251205T193000Z` pinned with Stage A/B risk notes, MCP drill artifacts, and sandbox-only items tagged per [Codex sandbox constraints](The_Absolute_Protocol.md#codex-sandbox-constraints). | Gate-runner replay captures parity diffs, checklist attachments, and review minutes updates in the Stage D ledger for downstream audits. | Mirror `logs/stage_c/20250930T210000Z-stage_c1_exit_checklist/summary.json`, `logs/stage_c/20251001T010101Z-readiness_packet/readiness_bundle/readiness_bundle.json`, and `logs/stage_c/20251205T193000Z-readiness_packet/review_minutes.md` on hardware runners before promotion.【F:logs/stage_c/20250930T210000Z-stage_c1_exit_checklist/summary.json†L1-L35】【F:logs/stage_c/20251001T010101Z-readiness_packet/readiness_bundle/readiness_bundle.json†L2-L195】【F:logs/stage_c/20251205T193000Z-readiness_packet/review_minutes.md†L1-L39】 Track weekly progress using the [Stage D execution ladder](stage_d_execution_ladder.md) so owners clear sandbox validation, simulation, doctrine, and hardware prep gates before requesting promotion.【F:docs/stage_d_execution_ladder.md†L1-L63】 |
| Promote Neo-APSU binaries with sandbox parity. | @neoabzu-core | Stage B rotation ledger and Stage C MCP drill establish checksum and rotation baselines for REST↔gRPC parity while environment-limited skips are documented per [Codex sandbox constraints](The_Absolute_Protocol.md#codex-sandbox-constraints). | Hardware rollout publishes crate fingerprints, connector rotation receipts, and parity traces that match the sandbox bundle before widening access. | Replay the rotation windows recorded in `logs/stage_c/20251001T010101Z-readiness_packet/readiness_bundle/readiness_bundle.json` and Stage B rotation drills while capturing new hardware parity manifests.【F:logs/stage_c/20251001T010101Z-readiness_packet/readiness_bundle/readiness_bundle.json†L120-L195】【F:logs/stage_b_rotation_drills.jsonl†L12-L45】【F:operator_api_grpc.py†L1-L148】 |
| Extend transport telemetry dashboards to hardware spans. | @release-ops | Sandbox Grafana board and handshake diff demonstrate transport parity but highlight missing heartbeat metrics; every deferred metric must be flagged as environment-limited per [Codex sandbox constraints](The_Absolute_Protocol.md#codex-sandbox-constraints). | Production bridge emits latency/heartbeat telemetry alongside REST↔gRPC checksums, and the diff is archived with dashboard links for readiness reviews. | Re-run the Stage C parity drill on hardware and ingest results into `monitoring/operator_transport_pilot.md` plus the Stage D ledger.【F:logs/stage_c/20251031T000000Z-test/summary.json†L1-L200】【F:logs/stage_c/20251031T000000Z-test/rest_grpc_handshake_diff.json†L1-L12】【F:monitoring/operator_transport_pilot.md†L1-L39】 |

Stage D bridge facilitators should run weekly checkpoints against the [Stage D execution ladder](stage_d_execution_ladder.md) and the [Stage D/E bridge review agenda](beta_bridge/agenda.md), requiring teams to submit the [Stage D/E evidence request template](beta_bridge/evidence_request_template.md) with parity logs, MCP rotations, or demo bundles before slots are confirmed in the readiness ledger.【F:docs/stage_d_execution_ladder.md†L1-L63】

#### Stage D Neo-APSU migration backlog

- **crown_decider.py → `neoabzu_crown::route_decision`.** Stage C readiness replays still inject the simplified sandbox stub, so Stage D must wire the Rust decision engine, MoGE orchestrator hooks, and validator gating while documenting the migration per the Rust doctrine workflow.【F:logs/stage_c/20250928T202834Z-stage_c3_readiness_sync/stage_b-b1-artifact1.stderr.log†L3-L15】【F:NEOABZU/crown/src/lib.rs†L86-L210】【F:docs/documentation_protocol.md†L5-L28】
- **crown_prompt_orchestrator.py → `neoabzu_rag::MoGEOrchestrator`.** The async pipeline remained stubbed during Stage C evidence capture; Stage D should route replay traffic through the Rust orchestrator so retrieval/ranking telemetry lands in the readiness ledger.【F:logs/stage_c/20250928T202834Z-stage_c3_readiness_sync/stage_b-b1-artifact1.stderr.log†L7-L15】【F:NEOABZU/rag/src/lib.rs†L122-L177】
- **state_transition_engine.py → `neoabzu_crown::route_inevitability`.** Deterministic rotation stubs left ritual gating untested; Stage D must emit inevitability journeys from the Rust bridge and record the transition evidence in the doctrine bundle.【F:logs/stage_c/20250928T202834Z-stage_c3_readiness_sync/stage_b-b1-artifact1.stderr.log†L5-L15】【F:NEOABZU/crown/src/lib.rs†L200-L210】
- **servant_model_manager.py → `neoabzu_crown` servant bridge.** Sandbox runs hid servant telemetry behind the local-registry stub; migrate to the Rust-managed registry so Stage D rehearsals capture invocation metrics and validator callbacks.【F:logs/stage_c/20250928T202834Z-stage_c3_readiness_sync/stage_b-b1-artifact1.stderr.log†L11-L15】【F:NEOABZU/crown/src/lib.rs†L102-L189】
- **memory_store.py → `neoabzu_memory::MemoryBundle`.** Stage C readiness reported `cortex layer empty`, forcing optional memory stubs; Stage D must close the gap by porting persistence and verification to the Rust bundle so all eight layers report ready.【F:logs/stage_c/20250927T201020Z-stage_c3_readiness_sync/summary.json†L590-L627】【F:NEOABZU/memory/src/lib.rs†L12-L120】
- **emotional_state.py → `neoabzu_crown` expression pipeline.** The in-memory sandbox shim suppressed persisted aura updates; Stage D must align emotional telemetry with the Rust expression options and doctrine logging expectations.【F:logs/stage_c/20250928T202834Z-stage_c3_readiness_sync/stage_b-b1-artifact1.stderr.log†L9-L15】【F:NEOABZU/crown/src/lib.rs†L60-L197】

Matrix status: the [APSU Migration Matrix](apsu_migration_matrix.md) now surfaces fixture links and Stage runtime shims, showing `crown_router` and `identity_loader.py` as ready (`ported`), the servant/decider/orchestrator/state/emotion stack as in-progress (`pending_rewrite` with sandbox stubs), and `memory_store.py` plus `connectors/operator_mcp_adapter.py` as hardware-validation rows (`wrapped`).【F:docs/apsu_migration_matrix.md†L7-L46】【F:component_index.json†L4-L98】 Stage D owners should refresh the matrix alongside readiness packets so Stage E/G reviewers inherit synchronized parity evidence and prototype pointers.

### Stage F+ status rollup

Weekly reviews track Stage F through Stage H using the consolidated
[Stage F+ execution plan](stage_f_plus_plan.md) so hardware adoption stays aligned
with the [readiness ledger](readiness_ledger.md) and sandbox policy rules in
[The Absolute Protocol](The_Absolute_Protocol.md#codex-sandbox-constraints).

| Stage | Status summary | Upcoming evidence | Responsible teams |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Stage F – Hardware replay soak alignment | Waiting on gate-runner access; readiness ledger rows for Stage B rotation, Stage C readiness bundle, and Stage E transport traces stitched together with sandbox policy references for each deferred skip while the Stage F hardware replay plan governs entry work.【F:docs/roadmap.md†L209-L247】【F:docs/stage_f_plus_plan.md†L11-L40】【F:docs/stage_f_hardware_replay_plan.md†L1-L162】【F:docs/readiness_ledger.md†L9-L27】 | Gate-runner parity diffs, MCP handshake refresh, and Stage E dashboard hash confirmation recorded with sandbox policy citations once hardware replay executes per the Stage F hardware replay plan.【F:docs/roadmap.md†L209-L247】【F:docs/stage_f_plus_plan.md†L31-L40】【F:docs/stage_f_hardware_replay_plan.md†L74-L162】 | @ops-team, @neoabzu-core, @qa-alliance |
| Stage G – Sandbox-to-hardware bridge validation | Bridge scripts prepped; readiness ledger rows linked to rollback drills and parity bundles per sandbox policy guardrails while awaiting hardware slot execution.【F:docs/roadmap.md†L248-L273】【F:docs/stage_f_plus_plan.md†L42-L64】【F:docs/readiness_ledger.md†L9-L27】 | Stage G hardware parity diffs and rollback transcripts signed with readiness ledger IDs and sandbox policy references.【F:docs/roadmap.md†L248-L273】【F:docs/stage_f_plus_plan.md†L55-L64】 | @ops-team, @neoabzu-core, @qa-alliance, @release-ops |
| Stage H – Production adoption & LTS cutover | GA cutover prep anchored to Stage G approvals; readiness ledger closures drafted with sandbox policy callouts awaiting final hardware telemetry and governance signatures.【F:docs/roadmap.md†L274-L299】【F:docs/stage_f_plus_plan.md†L66-L94】【F:docs/readiness_ledger.md†L9-L27】 | GA hardware cutover bundle, readiness ledger closure notes, and LTS governance checklist citing The Absolute Protocol sandbox policy.【F:docs/roadmap.md†L274-L299】【F:docs/stage_f_plus_plan.md†L74-L94】 | @release-ops, @operations-lead, @qa-alliance, @neoabzu-core |

#### Hardware replay prerequisites queue

- **Toolchains ready for gate-runner execution.** Stage F requires the Rust toolchain, Python bridge headers, and build prerequisites called out in the Neo-APSU onboarding and blueprint host prerequisites so hardware binaries match sandbox builds; queue installation tasks now so the window can start immediately when access resumes.【F:docs/stage_f_hardware_replay_plan.md†L42-L47】【F:docs/system_blueprint.md†L625-L627】【F:NEOABZU/docs/onboarding.md†L1-L36】
- **Sandbox evidence bundles staged for replay.** Keep the merged Stage C readiness bundle, Stage B rotation ledger, and Stage E transport snapshot packaged and versioned so operators can hand the exact artifacts to the hardware runner without re-collecting data once connectivity returns.【F:docs/stage_f_hardware_replay_plan.md†L35-L47】【F:logs/stage_c/20251001T010101Z-readiness_packet/readiness_bundle/readiness_bundle.json†L1-L210】【F:logs/stage_b_rotation_drills.jsonl†L12-L115】【F:logs/stage_e/20250930T121727Z-stage_e_transport_readiness/summary.json†L1-L142】
- **Memory load datasets verified.** Confirm the Stage B memory proof fixtures and latency dashboards referenced in the blueprint remain in storage with documented shard counts and verification scripts so the Rust bundle replay can capture hardware latencies without waiting for dataset prep.【F:docs/system_blueprint.md†L63-L81】【F:logs/stage_b/20250927T231955Z-stage_b1_memory_proof/summary.json†L1-L33】
- **Connector telemetry checkpoints drafted.** Pre-build the Grafana export templates and heartbeat expectations so the Stage F/H hardware runs can drop in live metrics alongside the sandbox traces flagged as environment-limited today.【F:docs/apsu_migration_matrix.md†L37-L45】【F:docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md†L196-L205】【F:logs/stage_e/20250930T121727Z-stage_e_transport_readiness/summary.json†L31-L115】
- **Documentation hooks for environment-limited evidence.** Ensure change logs and readiness packets are pre-populated with the `environment-limited` annotations mandated by the documentation protocol so hardware replay results can be inserted without reformatting when the dependency gap closes.【F:docs/documentation_protocol.md†L21-L53】

#### Stage D risk register

| Risk | Owner | Impact | Mitigation | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Hardware slot slip on gate-runner-02 delays parity replay. | @ops-team | Hardware rehearsal blocks Neo-APSU launch and Stage E countdown. | Reserve backup window and mirror the Stage C1 checklist artifacts in the production bridge ledger for rapid reschedule. | 🔄 Pending scheduling 【F:logs/stage_c/20250930T210000Z-stage_c1_exit_checklist/summary.json†L1-L35】 |
| Neo-APSU crate drift from rehearsal checksums. | @neoabzu-core | Divergent binaries invalidate transport parity traces. | Compare SHA-256 fingerprints against the Stage B rotation ledger before copying crates into hardware. | ⚠️ Watch list 【F:logs/stage_b_rotation_drills.jsonl†L24-L58】 |
| Transport metrics omit hardware spans after bridge cutover. | @release-ops | Beta readiness packet lacks production telemetry. | Attach the Stage D handshake diff to Grafana dashboards and verify parity metrics stream alongside sandbox history. | 🛠️ In progress 【F:logs/stage_c/20251031T000000Z-test/rest_grpc_handshake_diff.json†L1-L12】 |
| Emotional telemetry still routes through sandbox shims. | @ops-team | Aura logging remains uncertified for Stage D until gate-runner sensors feed the native pipeline. | Reserve gate-runner execution to replay the memory load proof with hardware instrumentation and refresh the readiness packet. | ⚠️ Watch list 【F:logs/stage_b/20250929T210655Z-stage_b1_memory_refresh/after/summary.json†L20-L29】 |

### Stage E beta readiness snapshot

| Objective | Owner | Entry Criteria | Exit Criteria | Hardware Replay Reference |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Lock REST↔gRPC parity as a beta gate. | @release-ops | Stage C parity drill and Stage E transport readiness snapshot confirm checksum matches while flagging missing latency metrics, all tagged as environment-limited per [Codex sandbox constraints](The_Absolute_Protocol.md#codex-sandbox-constraints). | Weekly beta reviews include checksum-matched trace bundles, contract test results tied to Grafana dashboards with hardware spans, and the recorded sandbox exports maintained under `tests/fixtures/transport_parity/`. | Replay the Stage C handshake bundle during hardware rehearsals, refresh the Stage E JSON exports, and attach updated traces to `logs/stage_e/20250930T121727Z-stage_e_transport_readiness/` before beta sign-off.【F:logs/stage_c/20251031T000000Z-test/summary.json†L1-L200】【F:logs/stage_e/20250930T121727Z-stage_e_transport_readiness/summary.json†L1-L142】【F:tests/transport_parity/test_recorded_contracts.py†L1-L209】【F:monitoring/operator_transport_pilot.md†L54-L105】 |
| Restore connector heartbeat telemetry. | @integration-guild | Stage C bundle and Stage E readiness report both show `heartbeat_emitted: false` and missing latency metrics for operator, upload, and Crown connectors; note each deferred metric per [Codex sandbox constraints](The_Absolute_Protocol.md#codex-sandbox-constraints). | Hardware replay exports heartbeat payloads and latency series for all connectors, updating the readiness packet and Grafana dashboards. | Capture heartbeat payloads during the gate-runner replay and publish them alongside the Stage E connector traces for downstream squads.【F:logs/stage_c/20251031T000000Z-test/summary.json†L7-L50】【F:logs/stage_e/20250930T121727Z-stage_e_transport_readiness/summary.json†L34-L115】【F:monitoring/operator_transport_pilot.md†L1-L84】 |
| Document beta governance & approvals. | @qa-alliance | Stage C readiness minutes capture conditional GO status pending hardware reruns; beta launch plan references transport governance requirements, and every sandbox-only approval gap is logged per [Codex sandbox constraints](The_Absolute_Protocol.md#codex-sandbox-constraints). | Beta readiness packet includes updated minutes, sign-offs, and governance checklist entries aligned with hardware parity evidence. | Append the 2025-10-04 readiness review minutes and subsequent approvals to the Stage C packet before circulating the beta launch governance brief.【F:logs/stage_c/20251001T010101Z-readiness_packet/review_minutes.md†L14-L44】【F:docs/releases/beta_launch_plan.md†L47-L76】 |

Weekly Stage E reviews mirror the [Stage D/E bridge review agenda](beta_bridge/agenda.md); evidence owners should attach a completed [Stage D/E evidence request template](beta_bridge/evidence_request_template.md) when delivering sandbox or hardware proofs so PROJECT_STATUS links track back to the readiness ledger without additional reconciliation.
- **External comms alignment:** Stage E’s go/no-go packet draws on the Stage D bridge ledger plus the transport handshake artifacts already logged in the Stage C trial so communication owners can cite identical evidence in stakeholder updates and reference the Neo-APSU governance checklist for connector sign-off.【F:logs/stage_c/20251031T000000Z-test/rest_handshake_with_expiry.json†L1-L41】【F:logs/stage_c/20251031T000000Z-test/grpc_trial_handshake.json†L1-L71】【F:docs/connectors/CONNECTOR_INDEX.md†L1-L86】
- **Sandbox export governance:** Archive the recorded JSON suites in `tests/fixtures/transport_parity/` alongside weekly minutes so the readiness packet, dashboards, and beta rehearsal template all cite identical REST↔gRPC payloads, telemetry metrics, and MCP rotations. The contract suite enforces checksum stability and phase coverage, giving reviewers a deterministic parity ledger before hardware replay closes the environment-limited gaps.【F:tests/transport_parity/test_recorded_contracts.py†L1-L209】【F:monitoring/operator_transport_pilot.md†L54-L105】【F:docs/releases/beta_rehearsal_template.md†L1-L120】

| Stage E heartbeat latency instrumentation missing in sandbox snapshot. | @integration-guild | Beta rollout blocks until `operator_api`, `operator_upload`, and `crown_handshake` emit heartbeat metrics alongside the recorded parity traces. | Track the heartbeat panel on the continuous dashboard and refresh the readiness packet once latency signals land. | ⚠️ Watch list 【F:logs/stage_e/20250930T121727Z-stage_e_transport_readiness/summary.json†L31-L63】【F:monitoring/operator_transport_pilot.md†L1-L84】 |
| Telemetry schemas diverge across rehearsal bundles. | @monitoring-guild | Grafana dashboards drop fields during beta rehearsals. | Validate schemas against readiness packet structure before exporting the beta rehearsal bundle. | ⚠️ Watch list 【F:logs/stage_c/20251001T010101Z-readiness_packet/readiness_bundle/readiness_bundle.json†L1-L185】 |
| Beta comms lack signed transport approvals. | @release-ops | External announcement slips without documented sign-off. | Capture signatures in the beta readiness packet and archive alongside Stage D bridge sign-offs. | 🔄 Pending approval 【F:logs/stage_c/20251031T000000Z-test/grpc_trial_handshake.json†L1-L71】 |

### Stage F soak entry controls

Stage F entry requires both the sandbox evidence bundle and a confirmed
hardware schedule to prevent promotions without live replay coverage.
Follow the [Stage F hardware replay plan](stage_f_hardware_replay_plan.md)
before approving the soak handoff so operators, QA, and Neo-APSU owners
execute the same checklist and evidence capture cadence.【F:docs/stage_f_hardware_replay_plan.md†L74-L162】

Stage G approvals demonstrate that sandbox-to-hardware bridge requirements have been satisfied with documented rollback drills, checksum parity diffs, and signed evidence bundles ahead of production bridge activities. Weekly status reviews should verify the approvals YAML files remain in sync with roadmap Stage G tasks and the doctrine checkpoint list in [The Absolute Protocol](The_Absolute_Protocol.md#stage-gate-alignment).

## Deprecation Roadmap

- **Pydantic field aliases** – migrate remaining models away from deprecated
  `Field` parameters and switch to explicit `alias` and
  `populate_by_name` configuration.
- **FastAPI lifespan** – replace `@app.on_event` startup and shutdown hooks
  with the `lifespan` context manager before the old API is removed.

## Getting Started

See [README.md](../README.md) for installation instructions and additional documentation links. Contributors are encouraged to run tests frequently and document any new modules under `docs/`.
