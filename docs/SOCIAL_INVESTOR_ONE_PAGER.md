# ABZU: Social Investor One-Pager

---

## Project

ABZU is an open research framework exploring ritual and narrative-driven intelligence. The system blends symbolic reasoning with emotional memory to build adaptive creative tools. Core orchestration happens in the [CROWN kernel](Crown_GUIDE.md), which delegates tasks across persona layers. The [QNL OS](../README_QNL_OS.md) translates quantum narrative representations into music and code. Operational logistics are handled through [Dark Layer Operations](operations.md) to keep deployments transparent and recoverable.

## Top 3 Use Cases

1. **Community Education Labs** – modular classroom kits allow students to experiment with voice, vision, and narrative AI while maintaining data sovereignty.
2. **Cultural Memory Archives** – ingest local stories and music, embed them through the QNL pipeline, and surface them through responsive avatars.
3. **Accessible Creative Instruments** – provide adaptive music and storytelling companions that respond to emotion and intent in real time.
