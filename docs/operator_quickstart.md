# Operator Quickstart

A concise orientation for operators interacting with ABZU.

## Triple-Reading Rule
Before issuing commands or editing code, read [blueprint_spine.md](blueprint_spine.md) three times as mandated by the [The Absolute Protocol](The_Absolute_Protocol.md). The repetition ensures the project's structure and intent are internalized.

## Consent Logging
Record explicit consent for every session. Log the operator, participants, timestamp, and scope in the canonical ledger so actions remain auditable and reversible. Reference the ethical laws in the [nazarick_manifesto.md](nazarick_manifesto.md) when verifying that consent covers all planned interactions.
