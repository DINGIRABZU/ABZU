# Stage C Readiness Review Packet — 2025-09-27

## Run overview
- Stage C3 readiness sync `20250927T201020Z` generated the consolidated bundle but flagged the overall status as `error` because Stage B inputs still carry risk notes while Stage A tasks closed cleanly.【F:logs/stage_c/20250927T201020Z-stage_c3_readiness_sync/summary.json†L1-L218】
- The readiness bundle at `logs/stage_c/20250927T201020Z-stage_c3_readiness_sync/readiness_bundle.json` remains the source of record for individual slug summaries and artifact pointers feeding this packet.【F:logs/stage_c/20250927T201020Z-stage_c3_readiness_sync/summary.json†L3-L8】【F:logs/stage_c/20250927T201020Z-stage_c3_readiness_sync/summary.json†L209-L218】

## Stage A recap
- **A1 boot telemetry** completed successfully in 17.6 s, archiving both stdout/stderr artifacts and noting sandbox overrides covering GLM integration, Crown orchestration, memory, and session logger instrumentation.【F:logs/stage_c/20250927T201020Z-stage_c3_readiness_sync/summary.json†L12-L55】
- **A2 crown replays** captured all five scripted scenarios with the sandbox override banner preserved in the stderr tail for traceability in the packet.【F:logs/stage_c/20250927T201020Z-stage_c3_readiness_sync/summary.json†L56-L100】
- **A3 alpha gate shakeout** finished in 2.25 s and documents environment-limited skips (build/health/tests) alongside the sandbox override roster so reviewers can trace deferred hardware validations.【F:logs/stage_c/20250927T201020Z-stage_c3_readiness_sync/summary.json†L101-L207】

## Stage B risks to resolve
- **B1 memory proof** executed against 1,000 vector records but stayed in a stubbed bundle with zero ready layers, raising the risk notes that block Stage B sign-off until the NeoABZU memory backend is restored.【F:logs/stage_c/20250927T201020Z-stage_c3_readiness_sync/summary.json†L220-L305】
- **B3 connector rotation** keeps Stage B rehearsal contexts accepted yet leaves the Stage C prep context pending; the readiness sync highlights this outstanding promotion step for the cross-team agenda.【F:logs/stage_c/20250927T201020Z-stage_c3_readiness_sync/summary.json†L220-L283】

## MCP drill artifacts
- The Stage C4 operator MCP drill `20250927T225213Z` produced fresh handshake and heartbeat payloads, confirming accepted contexts for both Stage B rehearsal and Stage C prep while locking the credential expiry at `2025-09-29T22:52:24Z`.【F:logs/stage_c/20250927T225213Z-stage_c4_operator_mcp_drill/summary.json†L1-L131】
- Sandbox overrides remained active during the drill; the stderr tail mirrors the environment-limited warnings and is copied into the packet alongside the JSON artifacts for governance records.【F:logs/stage_c/20250927T225213Z-stage_c4_operator_mcp_drill/summary.json†L20-L82】

## Credential rotation ledger
- `logs/stage_b_rotation_drills.jsonl` now includes the `20250927T225224Z-PT48H` window confirming the operator API connector maintains the 48‑hour rotation cadence expected by the doctrine checks.【F:logs/stage_b_rotation_drills.jsonl†L49-L53】

## Cross-team review focus
- Memory guild to present a remediation plan that restores at least one ready NeoABZU layer before beta planning can proceed.
- Integration guild to secure Stage C prep acceptance for the operator connectors and report the final credential promotion timeline.
- Ops to confirm sandbox overrides lifted (or documented with rehearsal hosts) for the affected subsystems before recommending Stage D entry.

## Media provenance update
- Stage C2 scripted demo outputs now reference the Stage B bundle instead of committing audio/video directly; use `--copy-media` when running `scripts/stage_c_scripted_demo.py` if reviewers require local stems.【F:scripts/stage_c_scripted_demo.py†L369-L441】【F:scripts/stage_c_scripted_demo.py†L441-L472】
- The Stage C evidence tree retains `.gitignore` sentinels for media directories so auditors know to fetch stems from the Stage B archive rather than git.【F:logs/stage_c/20250928T130000Z-stage_c2_demo_storyline/demo_storyline/audio/.gitignore†L1-L3】【F:logs/stage_c/20250928T130000Z-stage_c2_demo_storyline/demo_storyline/video/.gitignore†L1-L3】【F:logs/stage_b/20250921T230434Z/rehearsals/session_01/session_manifest.json†L7-L19】
