# Stage C Readiness Review Packet — 2025-09-28

## Run overview
- Stage C3 readiness sync `20250928T202834Z` rebuilt the consolidated bundle and now reports `requires_attention` only because Stage A sandbox warnings persist—the Stage B snapshot cleared prior risk notes after the refreshed memory proof and connector rotation finished cleanly.【F:logs/stage_c/20250928T202834Z-stage_c3_readiness_sync/summary.json†L1-L210】
- The readiness bundle at `logs/stage_c/20250928T202834Z-stage_c3_readiness_sync/readiness_bundle.json` remains the source of record for individual slug summaries and artifact pointers feeding this packet.【F:logs/stage_c/20250928T202834Z-stage_c3_readiness_sync/summary.json†L6-L24】

## Stage A recap
- **A1 boot telemetry** completed successfully in 12.7 s with sandbox overrides recorded alongside stdout/stderr artifacts for traceability.【F:logs/stage_c/20250928T202834Z-stage_c3_readiness_sync/stage_a-a1-summary.json†L1-L47】
- **A2 crown replays** captured the scripted scenarios with the sandbox override banner mirrored in the stderr tail preserved inside the bundle.【F:logs/stage_c/20250928T202834Z-stage_c3_readiness_sync/stage_a-a2-summary.json†L1-L46】
- **A3 alpha gate shakeout** documents the environment-limited skips (build/health/tests) and the active sandbox overrides so hardware follow-ups remain visible to reviewers.【F:logs/stage_c/20250928T202834Z-stage_c3_readiness_sync/stage_a-a3-summary.json†L1-L83】

## Stage B readiness snapshot
- **B1 memory proof** rebuilt the cortex dataset against 1,000 vector records with all eight layers ready, zero query failures, and the native bundle restored.【F:logs/stage_c/20250928T202834Z-stage_c3_readiness_sync/stage_b-b1-summary.json†L1-L40】
- **B2 sonic rehearsal** exported a fresh `stage_b_rehearsal_packet.json` with every connector marked `doctrine_ok`, no dropouts, and accepted contexts for the rehearsal bridge.【F:logs/stage_c/20250928T202834Z-stage_c3_readiness_sync/stage_b-b2-summary.json†L1-L38】
- **B3 connector rotation** captured the accepted `stage-b-rehearsal` and `stage-c-prep` contexts while logging the `20250928T001910Z-PT48H` rotation window that holds credential expiry at 2025-09-30T00:19:10Z.【F:logs/stage_c/20250928T202834Z-stage_c3_readiness_sync/stage_b-b3-summary.json†L1-L66】

## MCP drill artifacts
- The Stage C4 operator MCP drill `20250927T225213Z` produced fresh handshake and heartbeat payloads, confirming accepted contexts for both Stage B rehearsal and Stage C prep while locking the credential expiry at `2025-09-29T22:52:24Z`.【F:logs/stage_c/20250927T225213Z-stage_c4_operator_mcp_drill/summary.json†L1-L131】
- Sandbox overrides remained active during the drill; the stderr tail mirrors the environment-limited warnings and is copied into the packet alongside the JSON artifacts for governance records.【F:logs/stage_c/20250927T225213Z-stage_c4_operator_mcp_drill/summary.json†L20-L82】

## Credential rotation ledger
- `logs/stage_b_rotation_drills.jsonl` now includes the `20250927T225224Z-PT48H` window confirming the operator API connector maintains the 48‑hour rotation cadence expected by the doctrine checks.【F:logs/stage_b_rotation_drills.jsonl†L49-L53】

## Cross-team review focus
- Memory guild to present a remediation plan that restores at least one ready NeoABZU layer before beta planning can proceed.
- Integration guild to secure Stage C prep acceptance for the operator connectors and report the final credential promotion timeline.
- Ops to confirm sandbox overrides lifted (or documented with rehearsal hosts) for the affected subsystems before recommending Stage D entry.

## Media provenance update
- Stage C2 scripted demo outputs now reference the Stage B bundle instead of committing audio/video directly; use `--copy-media` when running `scripts/stage_c_scripted_demo.py` if reviewers require local stems.【F:scripts/stage_c_scripted_demo.py†L369-L441】【F:scripts/stage_c_scripted_demo.py†L441-L472】
- The Stage C evidence tree retains `.gitignore` sentinels for media directories so auditors know to fetch stems from the Stage B archive rather than git.【F:logs/stage_c/20250928T130000Z-stage_c2_demo_storyline/demo_storyline/audio/.gitignore†L1-L3】【F:logs/stage_c/20250928T130000Z-stage_c2_demo_storyline/demo_storyline/video/.gitignore†L1-L3】【F:logs/stage_b/20250921T230434Z/rehearsals/session_01/session_manifest.json†L7-L19】
