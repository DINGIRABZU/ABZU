# The Absolute Protocol Addendum — Stage C Sandbox Review

## Readiness packet snapshot
- `logs/stage_c/20251001T010101Z-readiness_packet/` stitches the refreshed Stage C3 readiness sync, Stage C1 exit checklist, and Stage C MCP parity drill into a single artifact so reviewers inherit the consolidated sandbox evidence set and hardware follow-ups.【F:logs/stage_c/20251001T010101Z-readiness_packet/readiness_bundle/readiness_bundle.json†L1-L185】
- The Stage C1 checklist summary enumerates the environment-limited phases (python packaging and coverage) deferred to the 2025-10-02 18:00 UTC hardware window on gate-runner-02; mirror those entries in roadmap, PROJECT_STATUS, and change logs until the hardware rerun lands in the packet.【F:logs/stage_c/20250930T210000Z-stage_c1_exit_checklist/summary.json†L1-L35】【F:logs/stage_c/20251001T010101Z-readiness_packet/readiness_bundle/readiness_bundle.json†L5-L74】
- MCP pilot parity traces—REST handshake, gRPC handshake, and diff artifact—sit alongside the readiness bundle so integration owners can reuse the latest Stage C drill outputs when extending hardware validations.【F:logs/stage_c/20251031T000000Z-test/summary.json†L1-L222】【F:logs/stage_c/20251001T010101Z-readiness_packet/readiness_bundle/readiness_bundle.json†L123-L185】
- Operator dashboards now ingest `operator_api_transport_latency_ms`, `operator_api_transport_errors_total`, and `operator_api_transport_fallback_total`, pairing the traces with Grafana overlays and fallback metadata documented in the transport pilot guide so auditors can confirm REST/gRPC parity throughout the pilot scope.【F:operator_api.py†L54-L374】【F:operator_api_grpc.py†L1-L148】【F:monitoring/operator_transport_pilot.md†L1-L39】

## Cross-team readiness review
- Release Ops, Memory, Connector, QA, and Ops leads reaffirmed the _conditional GO_ on **2025-10-01 19:30 UTC**, keeping the 2025-10-02 hardware packaging + coverage rerun and sustained MCP parity monitoring as gating items.【F:logs/stage_c/20251001T010101Z-readiness_packet/review_minutes.md†L14-L44】
- Record the beta hand-off schedule, hardware owners, and gRPC pilot scope from the minutes directly inside roadmap and PROJECT_STATUS updates so doctrine keeps a verifiable trail back to the signed decisions.【F:logs/stage_c/20251001T010101Z-readiness_packet/review_minutes.md†L14-L44】

## Required follow-ups
- Execute the hardware rerun on gate-runner-02 to capture python packaging and coverage artifacts, then drop the transcripts back into the readiness packet alongside the sandbox summaries.【F:logs/stage_c/20250930T210000Z-stage_c1_exit_checklist/summary.json†L1-L35】
- Extend MCP parity monitoring by folding the Stage C drill traces into the readiness ledger and roadmap notes, keeping the rotation window `20250928T173339Z-PT48H` visible for integration guild owners.【F:logs/stage_c/20251031T000000Z-test/summary.json†L1-L222】【F:logs/stage_c/20251001T010101Z-readiness_packet/readiness_bundle/readiness_bundle.json†L123-L185】
