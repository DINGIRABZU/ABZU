# The Absolute Protocol Addendum — Stage C Sandbox Review

## Readiness packet snapshot
- `logs/stage_c/20250928T151500Z-readiness_packet/` now aggregates the Stage C3 readiness summary, Stage C2 demo storyline, Stage C4 MCP drill transcripts, and the Stage C1 checklist stub so reviewers inherit a single evidence bundle while preparing the beta bridge hand-off.【F:logs/stage_c/20250928T151500Z-readiness_packet/readiness_bundle/stage_c3_readiness_sync_summary.json†L1-L120】【F:logs/stage_c/20250928T151500Z-readiness_packet/mcp_drill/stage_c4_operator_mcp_drill_summary.json†L1-L60】
- The readiness summary reiterates the sandbox `environment-limited` skips for build, health, and pytest phases; keep the same markers in downstream checklists so deferred hardware validation stays traceable.【F:logs/stage_c/20250928T151500Z-readiness_packet/readiness_bundle/stage_c3_readiness_sync_summary.json†L32-L120】
- The Stage C1 checklist stub documents that raw exit-checklist logs remain on the release-ops share until the hardware rehearsal replays the pytest coverage and packaging steps, mirroring the guidance in the checklist itself.【F:logs/stage_c/20250928T151500Z-readiness_packet/checklist_logs/stage_c1_exit_checklist_summary.json†L1-L32】【F:logs/stage_c/20250928T151500Z-readiness_packet/checklist_logs/README.md†L1-L11】

## Cross-team readiness review
- Release Ops, Memory, and Connector leads scheduled the cross-team readiness review for **2025-09-30 19:00 UTC** to approve the beta bridge hand-off, unblock the hardware pytest rerun, and green-light the first `operator_api` gRPC pilot within the Stage B3 rotation window.【F:logs/stage_c/20250928T151500Z-readiness_packet/readiness_bundle/stage_c3_readiness_sync_summary.json†L84-L120】
- Capture the review decisions in `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` and `docs/roadmap.md` immediately after the meeting so the sandbox-to-hardware bridge owners, gRPC adoption timeline, and credential rotation SLAs remain synchronized with doctrine.【F:docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md†L228-L244】【F:docs/roadmap.md†L76-L108】

## Required follow-ups
- Coordinate with CI to restore `pytest-cov`, `python -m build`, and connector credential fixtures so future Stage A runs clear the environment-limited skips called out in the readiness summary.【F:logs/stage_c/20250928T151500Z-readiness_packet/readiness_bundle/stage_c3_readiness_sync_summary.json†L32-L120】
- Stage B3 rotation owners must fold the gRPC pilot telemetry into the readiness ledger during the next 48-hour window; attach the new handshake and heartbeat payloads to the readiness packet after the review to keep doctrine references current. The follow-on stub drill added REST/gRPC trace captures and parity checksums to the ledger and archived the Stage C diff artifacts proving window `20250928T173339Z-PT48H` continuity for the beta bridge review.【F:logs/stage_c/20250926T222813Z-stage_c4_operator_mcp_drill/mcp_handshake.json†L1-L17】【F:logs/stage_b_rotation_drills.jsonl†L54-L58】【F:logs/stage_c/20251031T000000Z-test/rest_grpc_handshake_diff.json†L1-L12】
