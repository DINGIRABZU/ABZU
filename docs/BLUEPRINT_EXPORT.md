## Dependency Overview

ABZU’s dependencies and their relationships are documented separately:

- [Dependency Graph](dependency-graph.md) — visual map of module interactions.
- [Dependency Risks](dependency_risks.md) — areas requiring extra review.

These references help track how components rely on one another and make it easy to audit changes across the system.

## Feature Specs
