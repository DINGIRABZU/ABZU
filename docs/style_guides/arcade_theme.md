# Arcade Theme Style Guide

The arcade theme evokes classic 8-bit aesthetics with neon accents and pixelated typography. Use these guidelines when designing interfaces or documentation that rely on the theme.

## Color Palette
- **Background:** `#000000` (black)
- **Primary Accent:** `#00FF00` (neon green)
- **Secondary Accent:** `#FF00FF` (magenta)
- **Highlight:** `#FFFF00` (yellow)

## Typography
Use the bundled `PressStart2P-Regular.txt` sample to emulate retro glyphs when styling headings or decorative text. Render text with a monospace font and match the blocky proportions in the sample. Body copy should remain in the standard sans-serif stack for readability.

## Usage Rules
1. Icons reside in `style_engine/arcade_theme/icons/` as SVG files.
2. Sprite sheets for animations live in `style_engine/arcade_theme/sprites/` as plain-text grids.
3. Retro font samples are stored in `style_engine/arcade_theme/fonts/`.
4. Keep layouts minimal and honor pixel boundaries to preserve the retro feel.
