# Quarterly Lessons Review Checklist

The Codex knowledge base review happens once per quarter to capture the latest sandbox lessons and align roadmap decisions with new evidence.

## Pre-review preparation
- **Collect new lessons:** Gather additions for [`codex_lessons.md`](codex_lessons.md) from readiness minutes, roadmap updates, and sandbox run logs.
- **Update source material:** Ensure `change_log.md` entries reference the relevant pull requests or readiness ledger updates that triggered new lessons.
- **Draft evidence bundle:** Compile links to supporting artifacts (logs, dashboards, doctrine updates) so reviewers can verify each proposed lesson.

## Meeting flow
1. **Confirm objectives:** Restate the review goalâ€”updating Codex lessons, identifying roadmap impacts, and tracking doctrine changes.
2. **Walk recent lessons:** Present each new lesson with its source evidence and proposed knowledge base edits.
3. **Assess roadmap impact:** Note any execution ladder, roadmap, or charter checkpoints that must change based on the lessons.
4. **Doctrine alignment:** Identify doctrine, protocol, or readiness ledger updates required to reflect the latest insights.
5. **Action capture:** Assign owners and due dates for every follow-up, ensuring environment-limited items include hardware replay plans.

## Post-review updates
- **Publish summary:** Append key takeaways to [`codex_lessons.md`](codex_lessons.md) under the review summaries section, including roadmap or doctrine updates and their owners.
- **Refresh doctrine:** Update roadmap entries, readiness ledgers, and doctrine pages noted during the meeting.
- **Log actions:** Record assigned follow-ups in the readiness ledger and change log, linking to the evidence bundle for traceability.
