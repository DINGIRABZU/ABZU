# Quarterly Review Checklist

Use this checklist to run the Codex lessons quarterly review. Duplicate it into
your calendar or task manager so pre-work and post-work stay visible to all
owners.

## Pre-work (due one week before the review)

- [ ] Aggregate new sandbox lessons from `docs/knowledge_base/codex_lessons.md`
      drafts and team notebooks.
- [ ] Collect decision candidates and unresolved risks from the readiness ledger
      and prior review minutes.
- [ ] Confirm roadmap items that may require schedule adjustments based on new
      lessons or blockers.
- [ ] Circulate the agenda with assigned sections for Release Ops, Ops, Memory,
      Connector, and QA representatives.

## During the review

- [ ] Walk through the compiled lessons and confirm which updates belong in the
      canonical Codex knowledge base.
- [ ] Record decisions, owners, and hardware follow-up windows in the decision
      log.
- [ ] Identify roadmap checkpoints that need timeline changes and tag the
      responsible leads.

## Post-work (due within three business days)

- [ ] Update `docs/knowledge_base/codex_lessons.md` with approved changes and
      cross-link supporting evidence.
- [ ] Add new entries to the decision log and note any deferred items in the
      readiness ledger.
- [ ] Adjust roadmap milestones or dependencies to reflect the decisions.
- [ ] Update doctrine references (The Absolute Protocol, documentation protocol,
      readiness ledger) so the quarterly outcomes remain discoverable.
