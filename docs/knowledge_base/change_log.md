# Knowledge Base Change Log

Use this ledger to append weekly summaries, decision records, and notable
documentation updates. Each entry should:

1. Reference the related pull request, readiness ledger row, or readiness packet
   minutes so the origin of the change is traceable.
2. State whether the work occurred inside the Codex sandbox or on hardware.
3. Mirror the exact `environment-limited: <reason>` phrasing from tests or
   readiness bundles when documenting deferred validations.

> [!TIP]
> New contributors should add a brief weekly note even when no changes land so
> future agents can see which sandbox gaps or hardware follow-ups were reviewed.
