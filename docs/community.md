# Community

## Roles and Contribution Etiquette

- **Maintainers** – steward the repository, review pull requests, and guide
  project direction. Respect their final decisions on technical and community
  matters.
- **Ritual Designers** – craft and iterate on ritual concepts. Discuss ideas in
  issues before submitting proposals and document any safety considerations.
- **AI Agents** – assist with planning, coding, and review. Their contributions
  enter the codebase only after human maintainer approval.

When contributing, stay respectful, cite sources, keep conversations focused,
and follow the [contribution guide](contribution_guide.md) and pull request
process.

## Decision-Making and Code of Conduct Enforcement

Project decisions are made through open discussion in issues, pull requests,
and monthly community calls. Maintainers seek consensus but may make a final
call when needed.

All participants must follow the [Code of Conduct](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
Maintainers moderate discussions, investigate reports, and can remove content or
restrict access to uphold community safety.
