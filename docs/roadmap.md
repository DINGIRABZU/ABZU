This roadmap tracks five core milestones on the path to a stable release. Each stage lists its expected outcome so contributors know when to advance to the next phase.

## Milestone Stages

| --- | --- |
| Vision Alignment | Shared project vision documented and initial requirements agreed upon. |
| Prototype | Minimal viable framework demonstrating end‑to‑end flow. |
| Alpha Release | Core features implemented and internal testing underway. |
| Beta Release | External feedback incorporated with performance and security hardening. |
| General Availability | Stable release with complete documentation and long‑term support plan. |

## Maintenance

Update this roadmap and `CHANGELOG.md` whenever a milestone is completed to record progress and guide future planning.
