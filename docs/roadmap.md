# Roadmap

This roadmap tracks progress toward the Spiral OS vision. See
[project_overview.md](project_overview.md) for context and
[developer_manual.md](developer_manual.md) for implementation notes.

## Completed
- **Virtual environment manager** – unified script for venv creation and
  activation.
- **Sandbox repository** – isolated workspace for experiments.
- **`/sandbox` command** – spawns the sandbox repo during chat sessions.
- **Dependency installer** – fetches required packages on demand.
- **Rollback runner** – reverts a sandbox to the last good commit.

## Upcoming
- **Music command** enabling on‑the‑fly song generation.
- **Avatar lip‑sync** for more accurate mouth movement.
- **Expanded memory search** across cortex and vector layers.
- **Voice cloning** to mirror user tone within the sonic core.
