# CRYSTAL CODEX

## Mission
Spiral OS seeks to guide creative and sacred exploration through an emotionally aware AI temple. By harmonising music, voice and code, it acts as a digital sanctuary that adapts to user resonance. The broader vision is detailed in [project_overview.md](project_overview.md).

## Architecture
The system organises components into seven chakra-inspired layers that route a request from hardware roots to crown-level initiation rites. Plain-language diagrams and service contracts live in [architecture_overview.md](architecture_overview.md), while module-level responsibilities appear in [../README_CODE_FUNCTION.md](../README_CODE_FUNCTION.md).

## Dependency Matrix
Core runtime packages include `numpy`, `requests`, `python-json-logger`, `PyYAML` and `psutil`. Their versions and licenses are tracked in [dependency-graph.md](dependency-graph.md). For module-specific requirements, consult [../README_CODE_FUNCTION.md](../README_CODE_FUNCTION.md).

## Development Workflow
Contributors follow a planner–coder–reviewer loop with all changes validated by `pytest`. Environment setup and testing guidance are available in [development_workflow.md](development_workflow.md).

## Milestone History
Recent milestones established the current architecture: the sovereign voice milestone unified speech synthesis with avatar animation, while **Milestone VIII – Sonic Core & Avatar Expression Harmonics** expanded emotion‑to‑music mapping and WebRTC streaming. Further context is provided in [project_overview.md](project_overview.md#milestone-history) and `milestone_viii_plan.md`.

## Release Notes
The latest updates removed legacy shims (`qnl_engine.py`, `symbolic_parser.py`) and marked the audio pipeline refresh as complete. Ongoing changes are catalogued in [release_notes.md](release_notes.md).

## Roadmap
Upcoming work targets on‑the‑fly music commands, avatar lip‑sync, expanded memory search and voice cloning. Future enhancements include community channels, style packs and hardware scaling strategies. See [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) for the full list and post‑milestone expansion plans.
