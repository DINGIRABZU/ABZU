# Quick Start Guide (Non-Technical)

Follow these steps to get the system running with minimal setup.

1. Run `bash scripts/easy_setup.sh` to download models and install the core dependencies.
2. Launch the local environment with `bash scripts/start_local.sh`.
3. *(Optional)* For a cloud deployment on Vast.ai, run `bash scripts/vast_start.sh --setup`.

These commands should be executed from the project root directory.
