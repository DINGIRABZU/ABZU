# Nazarick Narrative System

## Narrative Scribe
The narrative scribe records events that occur within Nazarick. It collects structured notes from the agents, preserves context, and threads new entries into the ongoing chronicle so future servants can reference past actions.

## Persona Registry
The persona registry catalogs known personas and their traits. When a new persona is invoked, the registry ensures consistent voice and behavior by retrieving stored attributes and updating them with fresh observations.

## Event Flow
1. Agents emit events as they interact.
2. The narrative scribe captures the event and links it to the relevant persona entry.
3. The persona registry updates stored traits and returns guidance to agents.
4. Downstream systems consume the enriched narrative for memory, analysis, or storytelling.

The narrative scribe and persona registry operate together to maintain a coherent history of activities across Nazarick.
