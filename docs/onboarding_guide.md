# Developer Onboarding Guide

This guide outlines how a new contributor can recreate and extend the system relying solely on the documentation.

## 1. Survey the Blueprint
Begin with the [Blueprint Export](BLUEPRINT_EXPORT.md) to locate foundational documents. Each entry provides a permalink template for a specific version of the file.

## 2. Prepare the Environment
Follow the setup documents:
- [Setup Guide](setup.md) for standard installation
- [Minimal Setup](setup_minimal.md) or [Full Setup](setup_full.md) depending on resource availability
- [Environment Setup](environment_setup.md) for dependency details

## 3. Understand the Architecture
Study the system design materials to grasp component responsibilities and data flow:
- [System Blueprint](system_blueprint.md)
- [Architecture Overview](architecture_overview.md)
- [Data Flow](data_flow.md)

## 4. Follow the Development Workflow
Use the process documents to build and modify modules:
- [Development Workflow](development_workflow.md)
- [Development Checklist](development_checklist.md)
- [Coding Style](coding_style.md)

## 5. Validate and Test
Ensure changes are safe and reproducible by consulting:
- [Testing Guide](testing.md)
- [Testing Music Pipeline](testing_music_pipeline.md)
- [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md)

## 6. Extend the System
With the architecture, workflow, and validation steps in hand, you can implement new features or adjust existing modules. Reference domain-specific guides in the `docs/` directory and follow the security practices outlined in [Security Model](security_model.md).

## 7. Share Knowledge
Update documentation when adding features so others can replicate your work. The [Developer Manual](developer_manual.md) and [Contribution Guide](contribution_guide.md) describe expectations for pull requests and reviews.
