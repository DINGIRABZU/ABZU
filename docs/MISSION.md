# Mission

## Guiding Principles

- Nurture a transparent development process that encourages curiosity and
  mutual support.
- Elevate accessibility so newcomers can participate without specialized
  infrastructure.
- Treat every contribution as part of a living archive that reflects
  collective wisdom.

## Non-goals

- Pursuing competitive surveillance or exploitative data practices.
- Locking the project behind proprietary barriers or closed ecosystems.
- Optimizing solely for performance at the expense of maintainability and
  clarity.

## Ethical Boundaries

Work proceeds only when it aligns with community wellbeing and the spirit of
the source texts. Features that enable harm, deception, or coercion are
rejected. Contributors are expected to disclose limitations, respect consent,
and uphold the Code of Conduct in all collaborations.
