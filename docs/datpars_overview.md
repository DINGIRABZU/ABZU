# DATPars Overview

## Goals

DATPars standardizes data parsing across Spiral OS. It aims to convert
raw inputs from external sources into structured events that the system can
route through memory and orchestration layers.

## Architecture

The module exposes lightweight interfaces for implementing format‑specific
parsers. Each parser adheres to a minimal contract defined in
[`datpars.interfaces`](../datpars/interfaces.py). Implementations can be
registered with a factory to keep ingestion pluggable.

## Integration Points

DATPars sits near the edge of the ingestion pipeline. Connectors and
operators hand raw payloads to a parser instance before handing the
resulting records to memory or RAZAR workflows. The placeholder package
currently defines only the core interfaces while concrete parsers live in
future extensions.

## Version History

- 0.0.0 – Initial placeholder with stub interfaces.
