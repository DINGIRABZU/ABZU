# System Overview

High-level orientation of ABZU's architecture and guiding design.

## Mission
ABZU cultivates mythic-technical intelligence under operator oversight, pairing system advances with operator-facing improvements. The project seeks transparent, ethical orchestration of multi-modal agents for research and creative work. See the [Project Declaration](project_mission_vision.md) for the full narrative.

## Triadic Stack
The core stack aligns three pillars:
- **Operator** – issues directives and approves escalations.
- **RAZAR** – routes commands and manages ignition.
- **Crown** – delegates work to servant models and aggregates memory.
This triad maintains a feedback loop that keeps human intent central. Refer to the [System Blueprint](system_blueprint.md#triadic-stack) for diagrams and flow details.

## Chakra Agents
Seven chakra agents steward the system layers, emitting pulse metrics and safeguarding energy flow. Each agent monitors its layer's health and reports anomalies to the operator. See [Nazarick Agents](nazarick_agents.md) and [chakra_heartbeat.md](chakra_heartbeat.md) for roles and telemetry.

## Memory Bundle
A unified five-layer memory bundle synchronizes short-term, episodic, and long-term context. Queries pass through the bundle, allowing agents to share state while preserving provenance. Detailed protocols and diagrams live in the [Memory Layers Guide](memory_layers_GUIDE.md).

## Avatar Stack
The avatar and voice stack renders per-agent personas for synchronized sessions. Visual and audio layers stream through the [avatar pipeline](avatar_pipeline.md) and related UI widgets, giving operators real-time presence cues.
