# Connector Index

Canonical registry of ABZU's connectors. Each entry lists the purpose, version,
primary service endpoints, linked agents, and current status. Operator interface
entries detail the supported chat, file, image, audio, and video flows. Update
this index whenever a connector's interface changes. For shared patterns across
connectors see the [Connector Overview](README.md). This index is
crossâ€‘referenced from [Key Documents](../KEY_DOCUMENTS.md) and
[The Absolute Protocol](../The_Absolute_Protocol.md).
