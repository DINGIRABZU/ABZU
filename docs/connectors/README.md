## Vision

Provide lightweight bridges between Spiral OS and external services while
maintaining clear versioning and protocols.

## Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- Network libraries as needed by each connector

## Deployment

Install required dependencies and import the connector module in your service or
agent.

## Configuration Schemas

Each connector documents its authentication parameters. See
[`CONNECTOR_INDEX.md`](CONNECTOR_INDEX.md) for field descriptions.

## Version History

- v0.1.0 â€“ initial connector guidelines

## Example Runs

Connectors bridge Spiral OS to external communication services. Each connector
follows these patterns and maintenance rules:

**Common Patterns**

- Exposes a `__version__` field for traceability.
- Provides one or more callable endpoints or interfaces.
- Documents authentication and network protocols used.

**Maintenance Rules**

- Update the entry in [CONNECTOR_INDEX.md](CONNECTOR_INDEX.md) whenever versions,
  endpoints, or protocols change.
- Increment `__version__` for any backward-incompatible changes.
- Keep modules lightweight with clear dependencies and minimal side effects.
- Supply or update tests and docs alongside connector changes.

These conventions keep integration layers consistent, discoverable, and easy to
maintain.
