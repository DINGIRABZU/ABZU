# Recursive Emotion Router with Sigil Interpretation

**Version:** 0.1
**Status:** Draft

## Overview
The Recursive Emotion Router (RER) integrates affective computing with symbolic sigil analysis. It recursively routes emotional signals through layered interpretation stages, leveraging sigil embeddings to modulate responses and produce context-aware affective outputs.

## Architecture
- **Emotion Ingress:** Collects multimodal emotion cues from text, audio, or biosignals.
- **Sigil Interpreter:** Maps detected emotions to corresponding sigils encoded in a symbolic knowledge base.
- **Recursive Routing Core:** Iteratively refines emotional state by traversing a directed graph of sigil-emotion relationships.
- **Response Generator:** Synthesizes personalized feedback or actions informed by the resolved emotional signature.

## Workflow
1. Ingest user signals and normalize them into an emotion vector.
2. Query the sigil knowledge base to retrieve candidate sigils linked to the vector.
3. Traverse the recursive routing graph, updating emotion weights until convergence.
4. Generate a response and log the resolved sigil pathway for auditing.

## Potential Applications
- Adaptive narrative systems that adjust tone via symbolic cues.
- Therapeutic interfaces using sigil-driven emotional guidance.
- Secure messaging channels encoding intent within sigil sequences.

## Next Steps
- Engage legal counsel to determine whether to pursue patent protection or publish defensively.
- Prototype the routing algorithm and benchmark against baseline emotion models.

## Version History
- 0.1 â€“ Initial draft.
