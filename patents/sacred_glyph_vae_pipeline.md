# Sacred Glyph VAE Pipeline

**Version:** 0.1
**Status:** Draft

## Overview
The Sacred Glyph VAE Pipeline describes a generative architecture that encodes and decodes symbolic glyphs associated with ritual semantics. A variational autoencoder (VAE) learns a latent space aligning geometric glyph structure with metaphysical labels, enabling controlled synthesis and interpretation of sacred symbols.

## Architecture
- **Glyph Encoder:** Convolutional or transformer-based module that maps input glyph images into a structured latent vector.
- **Latent Ritual Space:** Regularized manifold capturing relationships among glyph classes, ritual intents, and contextual embeddings.
- **Glyph Decoder:** Generative network that reconstructs glyph images or SVG paths from latent representations.
- **Guidance Signals:** Optional conditioning vectors (e.g., ritual intent, chakra alignment) to steer reconstruction.

## Workflow
1. Preprocess historical glyph datasets into a normalized vector form.
2. Train the VAE to minimize reconstruction loss and KL divergence while preserving ritual semantics.
3. Sample from the latent space to generate new glyphs or interpolate between existing ones.
4. Validate generated glyphs with symbolic integrity tests and human review.

## Potential Applications
- Augmenting ritual archives with novel glyph variations.
- Assisting practitioners in visualizing intent-specific symbols.
- Enabling downstream tasks such as sigil-based encryption or message passing.

## Next Steps
- Coordinate with legal counsel to evaluate patentability and decide between filing a patent or publishing as a defensive disclosure.
- Expand dataset coverage and refine latent regularization.

## Version History
- 0.1 â€“ Initial draft.
