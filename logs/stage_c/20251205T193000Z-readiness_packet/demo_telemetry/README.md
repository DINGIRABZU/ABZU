# Demo telemetry stub — environment-limited

- Status: `environment-limited: Demo telemetry export deferred; awaiting sandbox-to-hardware replay window.`【F:logs/stage_c/20251205T193000Z-readiness_packet/demo_telemetry/summary.json†L1-L5】
- Owners: @audio-lab and @qa-lead per the 2025-12-08 readiness review roster; align capture plans with the readiness ledger watch items.【F:logs/stage_c/20251205T193000Z-readiness_packet/review_schedule.md†L4-L13】【F:docs/readiness_ledger.md†L9-L27】
- Hardware follow-up: record live media and telemetry during the gate-runner-02 session (2025-12-12) and publish signed exports, replacing this stub before roadmap/status risks are cleared.【F:logs/stage_c/20251205T193000Z-readiness_packet/review_schedule.md†L8-L16】

Attach refreshed hashes to `docs/readiness_ledger.md` and `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` once the hardware capture lands so downstream reviewers inherit the updated evidence lineage.【F:docs/readiness_ledger.md†L1-L32】
