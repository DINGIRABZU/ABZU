# Stage C Readiness Packet — 2025-12-05 snapshot

This snapshot packages the latest sandbox evidence while hardware access remains
blocked. Reference it with the readiness ledger to coordinate owners and
follow-ups.

## Environment-limited checklist

- Stage B rotation ledger verification is tagged `environment-limited: MCP gateway and /alpha/stage-b3-connector-rotation unavailable in Codex sandbox`; treat the ledger as stale until gate-runner replay completes.【F:logs/stage_c/20251205T193000Z-readiness_packet/readiness_bundle.json†L1-L36】
- Demo telemetry export is stubbed with `environment-limited: Demo telemetry export deferred; awaiting sandbox-to-hardware replay window.` pending hardware capture.【F:logs/stage_c/20251205T193000Z-readiness_packet/demo_telemetry/summary.json†L1-L5】
- MCP handshake/heartbeat artifacts remain sandbox-only; bundle notes require hardware credentials before promotion.【F:logs/stage_c/20251205T193000Z-readiness_packet/readiness_bundle.json†L17-L33】

## Hardware follow-up instructions

1. Reserve the 2025-12-12 gate-runner-02 slot to replay `/alpha/stage-b3-connector-rotation` and `/alpha/stage-c4-operator-mcp-drill`, clearing the ledger and MCP deferrals.【F:logs/stage_c/20251205T193000Z-readiness_packet/review_schedule.md†L8-L16】
2. Capture live demo telemetry during the hardware session and replace `demo_telemetry/summary.json` with signed exports plus hashes before distributing the bundle.【F:logs/stage_c/20251205T193000Z-readiness_packet/demo_telemetry/summary.json†L1-L5】【F:logs/stage_c/20251205T193000Z-readiness_packet/review_schedule.md†L8-L16】
3. Update roadmap, PROJECT_STATUS, and the readiness ledger with refreshed hashes and owners once hardware evidence lands so doctrine reflects the cleared risks.【F:docs/readiness_ledger.md†L1-L32】
