# Readiness Bundle Snapshot — 2025-09-30

The readiness bundle summarizes Stage A/B/C evidence sourced from live log
artifacts. Each entry links directly to the underlying summaries so reviewers
can drill into telemetry, stdout/stderr, and handshake payloads without copying
files.

- `readiness_bundle.json` — canonical manifest describing Stage A/B/C runs,
  hardware rerun coverage, and checklist alignment.
- Referenced artifacts live under `logs/stage_a/`, `logs/stage_b/`, and
  `logs/stage_c/` alongside this packet. All paths are relative to the
  repository root to keep links portable.
