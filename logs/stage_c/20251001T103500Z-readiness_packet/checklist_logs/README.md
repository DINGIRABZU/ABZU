# Stage C Checklist Evidence — 2025-10-01 Refresh

This folder captures the Stage C1 exit checklist replayed on 2025-10-01 at
10:30 UTC. The sandbox run surfaces the blocked pytest/coverage items that
remain deferred to the 2025-10-02 gate-runner hardware window. Reviewers can
trace each failure to the updated checklist markdown and Stage A3 shakeout log
referenced in the summary JSON.

- `stage_c1_exit_checklist_summary.json` — structured summary referencing the
  Stage C1 rerun (`logs/stage_c/20251001T103012Z-stage_c1_exit_checklist/`) and
  the sandbox toolchain gap recorded in the Stage A3 shakeout.
- `../review_minutes.md` — go/no-go notes for the 2025-10-01 checkpoint,
  including hardware follow-ups and ownership.

Use these artifacts when mirroring the checklist to hardware or when updating
roadmap/status ledgers with the deferred tooling items.
