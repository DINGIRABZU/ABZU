# Readiness Bundle Snapshot — 2025-10-01

This bundle aggregates the Stage A/B readiness evidence consumed by the
Stage C3 sync executed at 10:32 UTC on 2025-10-01. It captures the active
Stage A risk notes (sandbox tooling gaps), Stage B rotation ledger excerpts,
and the contexts carried forward to the Stage C MCP drill.

- `readiness_bundle.json` — merged manifest emitted by
  `logs/stage_c/20251001T103221Z-stage_c3_readiness_sync/`, linking Stage A
  boot/replay/shakeout summaries with the latest Stage B rehearsals and
  credential rotation metadata.
- Credential rotation artifacts referenced here are mirrored under
  `../mcp_drill/` so the go/no-go packet stays self-contained.

All paths are relative to the repository root for offline review.
