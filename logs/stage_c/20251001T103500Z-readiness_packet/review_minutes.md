# Stage C Go/No-Go Checkpoint — 2025-10-01 10:35 UTC

- **Attendees:** Release Ops, QA, Memory, Connectors guild reps.
- **Decision:** _Conditional GO_. Sandbox evidence refreshed with the latest
  Stage C1 checklist, Stage C2 demo replay, Stage C3 readiness bundle, and
  Stage C4 MCP drill. Hardware promotion remains blocked on the 2025-10-02
  gate-runner rehearsal to supply pytest coverage and packaging artifacts.
- **Highlights:**
  - Checklist rerun (`logs/stage_c/20251001T103012Z-stage_c1_exit_checklist/`)
    marks pytest/coverage as **Status: blocked**, aligning with
    `docs/absolute_protocol_checklist.md` updates.
  - Scripted demo replay (`logs/stage_c/20251001T215051Z-stage_c2_demo_storyline/`)
    confirms parity against Stage B session `20251001T214349Z/session_01`
    with zero dropouts and max sync offset 0.067 s.
  - Readiness bundle (`logs/stage_c/20251001T103221Z-stage_c3_readiness_sync/`)
    still reports Stage A risk notes; bundle copied into this packet for
    downstream bridge teams.
  - MCP drill (`logs/stage_c/20251001T103349Z-stage_c4_operator_mcp_drill/`)
    executed with the sandbox stub to archive handshake/heartbeat traces and
    the active credential window.
- **Follow-ups:**
  - Ops to rerun Stage A3 on gate-runner-02 (2025-10-02 18:00 UTC) and attach
    pytest coverage/packaging evidence to this packet.
  - QA to mirror the readiness bundle into roadmap/status ledgers once the
    hardware replay closes the environment-limited gaps.
