# Stage C Readiness Packet — 2025-10-01 10:35 UTC

This packet consolidates the Stage C go/no-go evidence refreshed on
2025-10-01. It binds the Stage C1 checklist rerun, Stage C2 scripted demo,
Stage C3 readiness bundle, and Stage C4 MCP drill so reviewers inherit the
same sandbox artifacts referenced during the checkpoint meeting.

Folders:

- `checklist_logs/` — Stage C1 exit checklist summary with environment-limited
  notes and references back to the absolute protocol checklist.
- `demo_storyline/` — Stage C2 telemetry summary pointing to replay artifacts.
- `readiness_bundle/` — merged Stage A/B readiness manifest captured by the
  Stage C3 sync.
- `mcp_drill/` — Stage C4 handshake, heartbeat, and credential window pointers.

See `review_minutes.md` for the conditional GO decision and outstanding
hardware follow-ups.
