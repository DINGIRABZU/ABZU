# Cross-Team Readiness Review — 2025-10-03 18:00 UTC

**Attendees:** @release-ops, @memory-squad, @integration-guild, @qa-lead, @ops-team

## Agenda

1. Confirm Stage A hardware follow-up owners and risk notes
2. Review Stage B rotation ledger with credential window evidence
3. Validate Stage C MCP drill artifacts and parity attachments
4. Schedule beta-planning review using merged readiness packet

## Decisions

- **Beta kickoff status:** _Conditional GO_ maintained. The team locked a
  beta-planning review on **2025-10-05 19:00 UTC**, holding the merged ledger
  generated in `logs/stage_c/20251003T010101Z-readiness_packet/` so the
  distribution list can walk through the credential window evidence together.
- **Stage A hardware rerun:** No change—hardware window remains **2025-10-02
  18:00 UTC** on `gate-runner-02`. Owners (@ops-team, @qa-lead) will drop the
  transcripts into the checklist archive once the hardware attempt finishes.
- **Stage B rotation drill:** The latest rotation ledger entry (window
  `20250926T222814Z-PT48H`) now includes `credential_window` metadata derived
  from the Stage C4 handshake. The merged packet captures the snapshot at
  `mcp_drill/rotation_metadata.json` so future reviews can audit the accepted
  contexts.
- **Stage C MCP drill:** Handshake and heartbeat artifacts from
  `20250926T222813Z-stage_c4_operator_mcp_drill` remain the canonical evidence.
  The readiness packet mirrors the artifact paths and publishes a dedicated
  credential window JSON for beta planners.

## Action Items

| Owner | Action | Due |
| --- | --- | --- |
| @ops-team | Execute python packaging on gate-runner-02 and attach transcript to checklist archive. | 2025-10-02 |
| @qa-lead | Capture coverage rerun during the hardware window and update the readiness bundle. | 2025-10-02 |
| @integration-guild | Prepare beta-planning review deck with credential window screenshot from the rotation ledger snapshot. | 2025-10-05 |
| @release-ops | Circulate review invite and merged packet link to `beta-planning@lists.infra`. | 2025-10-03 |
| @memory-squad | Sync memory proof status into PROJECT_STATUS.md after review. | 2025-10-05 |

## Notes

- Checklist attachments continue to reference
  `logs/stage_c/20250930T210000Z-stage_c1_exit_checklist/` until the hardware
  rerun closes the open items.
- The readiness bundle now links directly to the rotation ledger snapshot and
  credential window artifacts so reviewers can align the MCP handshake evidence
  with Stage B rotations without scraping the JSONL ledger manually.
- Grafana parity monitoring remains focused on the
  `20250926T222814Z-PT48H` window while the gRPC pilot stays sandbox-only.
