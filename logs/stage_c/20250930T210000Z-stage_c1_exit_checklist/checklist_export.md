## Environment-limited follow-ups

- Hardware coverage rerun blocked in Codex sandbox; bridging to hardware host `gate-runner-02`.
- Wheel packaging requires external build chain; tracked via review minutes and readiness bundle hardware schedule.

## Attachments

- `pytest.log` — sandbox pytest transcript with environment-limited skips.
