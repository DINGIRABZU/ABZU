# Cross-Team Readiness Review — 2025-09-30 19:00 UTC

**Attendees:** @release-ops, @memory-squad, @integration-guild, @qa-lead, @ops-team

## Agenda

1. Validate Stage A/B/C evidence bundle
2. Decide beta kickoff readiness (go/no-go)
3. Confirm hardware validation schedule
4. Approve gRPC pilot scope

## Decisions

- **Beta kickoff status:** _Conditional GO_. Move forward with beta content prep as soon as the
  gate hardware rerun (packaging + coverage) completes on 2025-10-02.
- **Stage A hardware rerun:** Scheduled for **2025-10-02 18:00 UTC** on `gate-runner-02`. Owners:
  @ops-team (wheel packaging) and @qa-lead (coverage replay). Evidence to be dropped into
  `logs/stage_c/20250930T210000Z-stage_c1_exit_checklist/`.
- **Stage B subsystem validation:** No additional blockers. Memory load proof and sonic rehearsal
  artifacts accepted as final rehearsal evidence.
- **gRPC pilot:** Green-lit for the **operator_api** connector using the parity traces in
  `logs/stage_c/20251031T000000Z-test/`. Integration guild will extend the pilot to
  memory fetch flows once the beta kickoff closes the hardware gap.

## Action Items

| Owner | Action | Due |

## Notes

- Checklist attachments now link to live artifacts under
  `logs/stage_c/20250930T210000Z-stage_c1_exit_checklist/`.
- Hardware escalations recorded per Absolute Protocol sandbox bridge with host + schedule.
- Integration guild to monitor gRPC telemetry during Stage B3 rotation window `20250928T173339Z-PT48H`.
