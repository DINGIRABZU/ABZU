# Stage C Checklist Evidence — 2025-10-01 Packet

This directory tracks the Stage C1 exit checklist captured during the 2025-09-30
cross-team readiness review and reused for the 2025-10-01 readiness refresh.
All attachments reference live artifacts committed alongside this packet so
reviewers can inspect the sandbox transcript and scheduled hardware follow-ups
without leaving the repository.

- `stage_c1_exit_checklist_summary.json` — structured summary with environment-
  limited items, hardware rerun schedule, and attachment paths.
- `../review_minutes.md` — meeting outcomes and action items inherited by the
  beta kickoff plan.
- Underlying checklist sources live in
  `logs/stage_c/20250930T210000Z-stage_c1_exit_checklist/` and are referenced by
  relative path from the summary JSON.

When new checklist runs occur, add a sibling JSON summary and update this index
so the readiness packet mirrors the release-ops evidence vault.
