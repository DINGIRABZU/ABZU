# Cross-Team Readiness Review — 2025-10-01 19:30 UTC

**Attendees:** @release-ops, @memory-squad, @integration-guild, @qa-lead, @ops-team

## Agenda

1. Validate refreshed Stage A/B/C evidence bundle
2. Reconfirm beta kickoff readiness (go/no-go)
3. Track hardware validation schedule and risk notes
4. Broadcast updated packet paths to beta-planning distribution list

## Decisions

- **Beta kickoff status:** _Conditional GO_ remains in effect. Beta preparation
  stays gated on the 2025-10-02 hardware rerun (packaging + coverage) completing
  successfully on gate-runner-02.
- **Stage A hardware rerun:** Still scheduled for **2025-10-02 18:00 UTC** on
  `gate-runner-02`. Sandbox rerun attempt logged on
  `logs/stage_a/20251002T180000Z-stage_a1_boot_telemetry/` confirmed tooling
  gaps (`python -m build`, docker, SoX, FFmpeg, aria2c, pytest-cov). Owners:
  @ops-team (wheel packaging) and @qa-lead (coverage replay). Results will be
  dropped into `logs/stage_c/20250930T210000Z-stage_c1_exit_checklist/` for
  archival.
- **Stage B subsystem validation:** No new blockers. Memory load proof and sonic
  rehearsal artifacts remain green.
- **gRPC pilot:** `operator_api` parity verified by
  `logs/stage_c/20251031T000000Z-test/`. Integration guild continues monitoring
  the `20250928T173339Z-PT48H` rotation window and will widen scope only after
  the hardware gap closes.
- **Distribution list update:** @release-ops circulated the new readiness packet
  location (`logs/stage_c/20251001T010101Z-readiness_packet/`) to
  `beta-planning@lists.infra` so roadmap owners and beta planners consume the
  refreshed evidence bundle.

## Action Items

| Owner | Action | Due |
| --- | --- | --- |
| @ops-team | Capture python -m build transcript on gate-runner-02 and attach to readiness bundle. | 2025-10-02 |
| @qa-lead | Re-run pytest --cov during hardware window and update readiness packet attachments. | 2025-10-02 |
| @integration-guild | Publish gRPC pilot rollout plan referencing parity diff artifact. | 2025-10-03 |
| @memory-squad | Annotate memory load proof metrics in roadmap hardware section. | 2025-10-02 |
| @release-ops | Confirm beta-planning DL received packet update and refresh PROJECT_STATUS.md. | 2025-10-02 |

## Notes

- Checklist attachments continue to link to live artifacts under
  `logs/stage_c/20250930T210000Z-stage_c1_exit_checklist/` pending the
  gate-runner-02 replay.
- Sandbox remains environment-limited for packaging and coverage; risk notes are
  recorded in the Stage A readiness ledger and resurfaced here for visibility.
- Integration guild to monitor gRPC telemetry during Stage B3 rotation window
  `20250928T173339Z-PT48H` until hardware parity is confirmed.
