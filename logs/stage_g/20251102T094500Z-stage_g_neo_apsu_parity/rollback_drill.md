# Neo-APSU Hardware Rollback Drill

## Objective
Validate that Neo-APSU control plane services can revert to the sandbox replicas without losing credential rotation traces or MCP handshake context.

## Sequence
1. Export the Stageâ€¯G hardware manifest and compare it to `logs/stage_b_rotation_drills.jsonl`.
2. Pause the hardware workspace by setting `NEO_APSU_HARDWARE_ENABLED=0` in `neoabzu_crown.env` and `neoabzu_memory.env`.
3. Replay the sandbox rotation ledger with `python scripts/stage_b_smoke.py --replay-window 20250926T183842Z-PT48H`.
4. Confirm MCP adapters replayed fallback payloads through `tests/test_operator_transport_contract.py` with the `--sandbox` flag.
5. Reapply the hardware configuration, rerun the handshake suite, and confirm checksum parity before re-enabling the services.

## Telemetry Capture
