# Stage B rotation ledger — sandbox status

- Latest verification result: `environment-limited: MCP gateway and /alpha/stage-b3-connector-rotation unavailable in Codex sandbox` (see Stage C readiness snapshot).【F:logs/stage_c/20251205T193000Z-readiness_packet/readiness_bundle.json†L1-L36】
- Owners: @neoabzu-core coordinate parity replay for connector credentials per the readiness ledger watch list.【F:docs/readiness_ledger.md†L9-L27】
- Pending hardware action: execute `/alpha/stage-b3-connector-rotation` on gate-runner-02 during the 2025-12-12 window, capture refreshed hashes, and update the readiness ledger plus PROJECT_STATUS before clearing roadmap risks.【F:logs/stage_c/20251205T193000Z-readiness_packet/review_schedule.md†L8-L16】【F:docs/readiness_ledger.md†L9-L27】

Keep this README with the JSONL ledger so hardware reviewers inherit the sandbox caveat and know which follow-ups must complete before the evidence is trusted.
