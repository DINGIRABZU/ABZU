# Scribe Narrative Engine

The Scribe engine records each narrated event into durable memory. It accepts spans from Bana, enriches them with provenance, and exposes structured logs for downstream analysis.

Future iterations will emit optional `tracing` and `opentelemetry` spans so operators can audit narrative generation in real time.
