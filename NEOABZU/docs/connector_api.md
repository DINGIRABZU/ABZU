# Connector Plugin API

Connector plugins supply external context to the RAG pipeline. A connector is a
Python object or callable exposing a `retrieve(question: str)` function that
returns a list of dictionaries with at least a `text` field. The orchestrator
adds a `source` label to each result.

## Ranking Strategies

Results from memory and connectors may be ordered by a custom ranking strategy.
A ranking strategy is a callable `ranker(question, documents)` that returns the
sorted list of document dictionaries. Each dictionary should include a
`score` field. When no ranker is provided the orchestrator falls back to a
cosineâ€‘similarity ranking.
