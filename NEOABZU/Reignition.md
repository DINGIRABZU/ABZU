# Reignition

NEOABZU ignites a fresh substrate for ABZU components.

## Goals
- Establish a Rust workspace (`Cargo.toml`) for crates such as `core`, `memory`, and `vector`.
- Prototype computation through a minimal lambda-calculus interpreter with Python bindings.
- Maintain alignment with the architectural vision outlined in [docs/ABZU_blueprint.md](../docs/ABZU_blueprint.md) and
  the operational practices described in [docs/system_blueprint.md](../docs/system_blueprint.md).

This document tracks early milestones as we grow the workspace into a fully fledged system.
