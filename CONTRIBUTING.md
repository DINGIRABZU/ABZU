# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in improving ABZU! This guide covers environment
setup, coding conventions, testing, and the pull request process.

For details on chakra module architecture and version history, consult
[docs/chakra_architecture.md](docs/chakra_architecture.md) and
[docs/chakra_versions.json](docs/chakra_versions.json).

## Setup

Use Python 3.10 or later. Install development dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
```

A helper script prints a brief warning about download size:

```bash
./scripts/install_test_deps.sh
```

Runtime dependencies are pinned in `requirements.lock` which is generated from
`pyproject.toml`. After modifying dependencies, refresh the lock file and commit
the result:

```bash
uv pip compile --no-deps pyproject.toml -o requirements.lock
```

## Coding Style

Follow the conventions in [CODE_STYLE.md](CODE_STYLE.md). Highlights include:

- Four spaces per indentation level and lines under 88 characters.
- Imports grouped into standard library, thirdâ€‘party, and local sections.
- Docstrings for public modules, classes, and functions.

Run the standard tooling before committing changes:

```bash
ruff <paths>    # lint
black <paths>   # format
mypy            # type check
```

## Testing

Execute smoke tests and the unit test suite before submitting changes:

```bash
scripts/smoke_console_interface.sh
scripts/smoke_avatar_console.sh
pytest --maxfail=1 -q
```

Code coverage is enforced at 85%. Generate a report locally to ensure the
threshold is met:

```bash
coverage run -m pytest
coverage report
```

## Pull Requests

- Keep changes focused; submit separate PRs for unrelated fixes.
- Ensure documentation is updated and tests pass.
- Lint Markdown files with `markdownlint` and verify links using `markdown-link-check`.
- Request review from a maintainer and address feedback promptly.

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
