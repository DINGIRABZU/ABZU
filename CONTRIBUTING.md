# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in improving ABZU! This guide covers environment
setup, coding conventions, testing, and the pull request process.

## Setup

Use Python 3.10 or later. Install development dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
```

A helper script prints a brief warning about download size:

```bash
./scripts/install_test_deps.sh
```

Runtime dependencies are pinned in `requirements.lock` which is generated from
`pyproject.toml`. After modifying dependencies, refresh the lock file and commit
the result:

```bash
uv pip compile --no-deps pyproject.toml -o requirements.lock
```

## Coding Style

Follow the conventions in [CODE_STYLE.md](CODE_STYLE.md). Highlights include:

- Four spaces per indentation level and lines under 88 characters.
- Imports grouped into standard library, thirdâ€‘party, and local sections.
- Docstrings for public modules, classes, and functions.

Run static type checks with:

```bash
mypy
```

## Testing

Execute smoke tests and the unit test suite before submitting changes:

```bash
scripts/smoke_console_interface.sh
scripts/smoke_avatar_console.sh
pytest --maxfail=1 -q
```

Code coverage is enforced at 85%. Generate a report locally to ensure the
threshold is met:

```bash
coverage run -m pytest
coverage report
```

## Pull Requests

- Keep changes focused; submit separate PRs for unrelated fixes.
- Ensure documentation is updated and tests pass.
- Lint Markdown files with `markdownlint` and verify links using `markdown-link-check`.
- Request review from a maintainer and address feedback promptly.

By participating in this project, you agree to abide by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
