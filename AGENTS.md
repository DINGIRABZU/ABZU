# AGENTS

- Always read [docs/documentation_protocol.md](docs/documentation_protocol.md) before editing documentation.
- Follow the naming and structuring conventions described there when creating new docs.
- Review and refresh [docs/system_blueprint.md](docs/system_blueprint.md) before committing changes to components or documentation.
- Run `pre-commit run --files <modified files>` on all changed files before committing.

Deeper `AGENTS.md` files in subdirectories may override or extend these rules for files within their scope.
